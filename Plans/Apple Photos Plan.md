# Summary

Apple Photos as a source kind: albums and smart albums from the system Photos library, enumerated and materialized by the agent, added from the Mac app. Subordinate to `PLAN.md`, which places this in Phase 3, and to `MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md`, which owns what the panel looks like.

# Rationale

The window is showing a test folder. Every architectural claim this project has made about a source that is *not* a path — that a new kind is a new provider rather than a migration, that the source endpoint exists for kinds the app cannot see, that every privacy grant lives on the agent's bundle — is unproven until one exists, and Apple Photos is the only such kind before Phase 11. It is also the kind that decides whether "give me the bytes for this identifier" survives contact with an asset whose bytes are on somebody else's computer. Google Photos inherits whatever this settles, so getting it wrong here is a mistake that is made twice.

# Phases

- **Phase 1 — the spike.** — **run 2026-08-25. The approach holds; four things in this document do not.** `pgr_ctl photos-spike`, and no change to the kit at all. *The command was deleted on 2026-09-17; see References.* PhotoKit stays out of `PhotoGoRoundKit` until the measurements say the approach holds.
  - Request authorization; list albums and smart albums with identifier, title, subtype, and image count.
  - Time the fetch against the largest album, with `phys_footprint` sampled, so laziness is observed rather than assumed.
  - Pull N originals and compare each written file's `CGImageSource` pixel dimensions against `PHAsset.pixelWidth`/`pixelHeight`.
  - Classify each asset local or iCloud-optimized by attempting `isNetworkAccessAllowed = false` first, then retrying with `true`.
  - Print an edited photo's `.photo` and `.fullSizePhoto` side by side; print a Live Photo's whole resource list.
  - **Exit gate: the numbers exist and say the design works.** A written original that matches the asset's own pixel dimensions on an iCloud-optimized asset, a throughput figure split into local and downloaded, and a peak footprint that does not track the largest file pulled.
  - **Met.** Every written file matched its asset's dimensions, including downloaded ones. Footprint moved 16 kB writing 3.4 MB and nothing at all writing 2.9 MB — it does not track file size. Latency does not follow size either, but what governs it is not yet established. Numbers in *What Phase 1 measured*.
- **Phase 2 — the provider. Done 2026-08-26.** `PhotosCollectionSourceProvider` in the kit for `SourceKind.photosCollection`, behind a `PhotoLibrary` protocol seam the way `FolderSourceProvider` sits behind `FileAccess`. `SystemPhotoLibrary` is the only file that imports PhotoKit, and the seam vends values rather than `PHAsset`s so the provider's logic is exercised with no library and no grant.
  - `enumerate`, streaming; `existence`; `availability` from authorization status; `materialize` via `PHAssetResourceManager`.
  - Tests against a fake `PhotoLibrary`, so provider logic is exercised with no library and no TCC grant.
  - **Exit gate: `pgr_ctl` adds an album and the pool fills from it. Met** — `pgr_ctl sources add --album "167F1595-…/L0/040"` produced `#11 photos_collection 1 photos [ok]`, enumerated under Terminal's grant.
- **Phase 3 — done, 2026-08-26.** **Admitting a source that is not a path.** The only part of this work that is not additive.
  - `SourceStore.add` stops refusing every kind that is not `isFileBacked`.
  - `SourceRequest.resolve` gains a branch that validates a collection identifier by asking the provider, inside the same all-or-none batch rule.
  - `SourceSpec.init` stops appending a trailing slash to things that are not paths.
  - **Exit gate: a bad album identifier is refused at the door, naming itself, and changes nothing. Met** — `EditFailure.locatorsNotFound` names it, under the same all-or-none rule as a mistyped path, and a library that cannot be read refuses too.
  - Validation happens in `SourceStore.add` rather than through a validator passed into `SourceRequest.resolve`, as this plan proposed. `add` had to become `async` regardless, and `resolve` stays synchronous and free of any knowledge of providers.
- **Phase 4 — the service surfaces. Done 2026-08-26.** What the app needs and cannot get for itself.
  - **Versioning, decided 2026-08-25.** Each version is a whole set of routes, not a patch on the one below. `/v1/sources` lists only file-backed kinds, because a v1 client draws a Photos album as `040` — the last path component of an identifier — which reads as a folder that is not there. `/v2/sources` carries every kind and the album's `localizedTitle`, and is where these routes live. **Built ahead of this phase**, since the app needed the v1 filtering the day the provider landed. Since 2026-09-07 the v2 list also says whether an album is `missing` and `reconnectable`, and `POST /v2/sources/<uuid>/reconnect` is the one member action; see `Missing Albums Plan.md`.
  - `GET /v2/photos/albums` — the four sections, each sorted by name; identifier, title, kind, and an image count that is **absent until the background pass reaches it**. `authorization` travels in the same body, because "no albums" and "not allowed to look" must not arrive as the same empty array.
  - `GET /v2/photos/authorization` and `POST /v2/photos/authorization` — read the state, and raise the prompt. **v2, not v1 as this plan first said:** v1 is the file-backed set, and a v1 client has no business with Photos consent because it cannot draw a Photos source at all.
  - `SourceEndpoint.Wire` gains `title`, because a Photos locator has no last path component to name it by.
  - **Exit gate: `curl` lists the albums and adds one, and the agent is the only process that touched PhotoKit. Met.** Against the real library: **200 in 68 ms**, `authorized`, 439 collections, `counted: 0` — names first, exactly as designed, against the 34 seconds counting on demand would have cost. Sections came back 353 Albums · 65 Sharing · 13 Media Types · 8 Utilities, summing to 439, so nothing fell through the classifier. The background count reached 439/439 in about forty seconds, matching Phase 1's estimate. Adding is covered too, including that a locator already listed is absorbed with **200 and an empty array** rather than refused — only a locator that does not *resolve* refuses the batch.
- **Phase 5 — the picker in the app. Done 2026-08-26.** Settings is two panels, and the picker is what the upper one opens.
  - **Done.** An *Apple Photos* panel above the file-backed list: the chosen collections comma-separated, the total photo count, and a `Select Collections…` button, still disabled. The app moved to `/v2/sources` to get `title`, without which the panel would name an album `040`.
  - **Done.** Settings became a `Window` scene of the app's own, because the `Settings` scene would not yield a resizable window at any price. `CommandGroup(replacing: .appSettings)` buys the menu item and `⌘,` back.
  - **Done.** The picker: its own resizable `Window`, an outline of Photos' four sections with folders nested inside, a checkbox per album, counts arriving as the agent's background pass fills them, and three-state checkboxes on folders. Favorites is pinned above the headings. Applying is one `POST /v2/sources` for what was ticked and a `DELETE` each for what was unticked, adds first.
  - **Done.** The unauthorized state: an Allow button while `notDetermined`, and a pointer to System Settings once somebody has decided, since nothing the app does can reopen that prompt.
  - **Exit gate: a person who has never opened a terminal can put their Favorites on their screen. Met** — and it is one click, because Favorites is the first row in the box.
- **Deliberately not here.** `PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver`; pinned individual assets (`SourceKind.photosAsset`); the whole library as one source; the panel's per-kind sections. Each is argued below.
- **Open, found 2026-09-07 against a library that had stopped answering.** Both surfaced while hardening the agent for a hostile Photos API, on a Mac migrating a large library onto a spinning disk. Neither is a regression: each is a case the earlier phases never met because a healthy library answers in milliseconds.
  - **An album added while the library is silent has no name, and the panel draws `040`.** `SourceStore.resolveLocators` (`MacOS/Shared/Sources/PhotoGoRoundKit/Sources/SourceStore+Editing.swift:155`) skips `describe` when the library has just failed to answer, so nothing is stored; `SourceEndpoint.wire` (`MacOS/Agent/Endpoints/Sources/SourceEndpoint.swift:521`) then asks the library live, fails too, and sends no `title`; and `SourceService.Source.name` (`MacOS/Desktop/Sources/SourceService.swift:127`) falls back to the locator's last component — which Phase 4 already calls out as reading like a folder that is not there. Observed for Favorites.
    - **The agent knows the name and is not asked for it.** `PhotosCollectionCatalog` holds the listing the picker was shown, titles included, and does not expire it — `listing()` at `MacOS/Shared/Sources/PhotoGoRoundKit/Photos/PhotosCollectionCatalog.swift:61`. `RunCommand` hands the catalog to `PhotosEndpoint` only; giving it to `SourceEndpoint` as well would let `wire` name an album from cache, at no library call.
    - **The app may not need to ask anybody.** `CollectionsModel` already holds that listing in this process, which is where the names on the picker's own rows come from. The wrinkle is lifetime: it belongs to the picker window and holds a listing only once somebody has opened it, so the panel cannot rely on it alone — the two want somewhere to share what they know.
    - **And the fallback itself is wrong for a collection.** A Photos album's locator has no last component worth showing; an honest placeholder beats a fragment of an identifier whatever else is fixed.
  - **Folders and Files waits on Apple Photos.** One `GET /v2/sources` produces both panels — `SourceEndpoint.list` at `MacOS/Agent/Endpoints/Sources/SourceEndpoint.swift:276`, read by `SourcesModel.refresh` at `MacOS/Desktop/Sources/SourcesModel.swift:231` — so the file-backed half, which needs nothing from PhotoKit and which this unsandboxed app can `stat` for itself, cannot draw until the Photos half is ready. Observed: reopening Settings showed nothing at all until both panels' statuses had arrived, every poll costing the agent's whole response budget first.
    - The split is a `kind` filter on `GET /v2/sources` and two independent polls, each with its own `hasRead` and `readFailure` — *completely separate* meaning a wedged library can neither delay, blank, nor speak for the folder list. `trouble` stays shared, since it belongs to actions and the controls that raise it act on one panel at a time.
  - **An add against a silent library takes about thirteen seconds**, being `SourceStore.validationLimit` and then the endpoint's `RequestBudget`, both spent waiting on nothing. Bounded, and slow enough that it does not feel like it worked. Naming from cache would remove most of it, since `describe` is the expensive half and the catalog already has the answer.

# Design Decisions

- **The agent owns the Photos grant, and the app never links PhotoKit.** `MacOS/Agent/Resources/Info.plist` carries `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` for `com.sydpolk.photogoround.server` and says why — written by `Scripts/make-agent-bundle.sh` until 2026-09-19, and by the `Photo-Go-Round Server` target since. One bundle, one consent, one entry in the Settings privacy list. **Achieved differently than planned, 2026-08-26**: rather than a separate target for the PhotoKit binding, `PhotoGoRoundAgentAPI` was split out of the kit to carry preferences, the host environment, the wire's value types, and `SourceAvailability`. The app links that and no longer links `PhotoGoRoundKit` at all, so PhotoKit sits in the kit and reaches no client.
- **The album list comes over HTTP, for that reason and no other.** It would be trivial for the app to fetch its own `PHAssetCollection`s, and doing so would be a second TCC grant on a second bundle — which is the thing `PLAN.md`'s *TCC: unsandboxed does not mean unrestricted* decided against.
- **The spike changes nothing in the kit.** A measurement that requires a schema, a provider, and a registration to run is not a spike, it is Phase 2 with a worse name.
- **`.readWrite` authorization, because there is no read-only level.** `PHAccessLevel` has exactly `.addOnly` and `.readWrite`, and `.addOnly` grants writing only. Reading an album requires `.readWrite`; the usage string is where the asymmetry gets explained.
- **Storage is always `.materialized`.** There is no path to reference. A Photos asset's bytes are ours only once we have copied them. **Re-examined after the spike found that Photos retains downloaded originals, and upheld: the double storage cost is worth paying.**
- **A collection that stops resolving is `.offline`, never `.gone`.** `PLAN.md` is explicit: switching system libraries fails every stored identifier at once, and answering `.gone` would delete a library over it. **And since 2026-09-07 its photographs are *unknown*, never `.absent`.** `existence` asked only whether the library was readable, so a rebuild that renumbered two albums answered `.absent` for every cached photograph in them against a perfectly readable library and deleted each as its turn came — the same fact `availability` was calling offline. The album is asked before the photograph now. See `Missing Albums Plan.md`.
- **`.fullSizePhoto` when present, `.photo` otherwise, matched on exact resource type.** The first is the edited render, the second the original. Measured against a real Live Photo, the resource to avoid is **`.fullSizePairedVideo`** rather than `.pairedVideo`: it sits immediately before `.fullSizePhoto` in the list and is called `FullSizeRender.mov` against the photo's `FullSizeRender.heic`, so any prefix, position, or filename heuristic takes a movie.
- **Videos are excluded at the fetch**, by `PHFetchOptions.predicate` on `mediaType == PHAssetMediaType.image.rawValue`, so they never enter the row set at all.
- **`requestData` rather than `writeData` for materialize.** Both stream. Only `requestData` returns a request id and can be cancelled — an abandoned `writeData` keeps running in the daemon and may still deliver its file, so a source that times out repeatedly accumulates work we can neither see nor stop.
- **A fetch may stall for five minutes, and that is designed around rather than explained. Explained 2026-08-26: it was a wedged iCloud, not PhotoKit.** A re-run on a healthy machine moved the median from 301.5 s to 0.8 s with no fetch near the toll. The design still assumes a fetch can stall, because a provider can always behave badly — but it is no longer assuming it on this evidence, which was a sick machine measured once. See *iCloud latency does not follow file size*.
- **No materialize timeout below 305 seconds. *The evidence for this is gone; the number has not been changed.*** It was chosen because three of five measured downloads would have failed a sixty-second bound, each succeeding at 301.5 s — and 2026-08-26 established that those three were a wedged iCloud rather than anything about PhotoKit. Against a healthy median of 0.8 s the Photos bound of 905 seconds is roughly a thousand times what a fetch takes. **Left as it stands deliberately**, because the bound's job is to stop a fetch holding a slot forever rather than to make it quick, and lowering it on one clean day's measurements would be repeating the mistake that set it. It wants a decision, not an edit.
- **`downloadConcurrency` above one for Photos, whether or not stalls overlap.** With one in flight, a single stalled asset idles the whole source and nothing says why. Several in flight keeps the queue moving past it, which holds even if `photosd` serialises the work. The five-minute figure this was written against turned out to be a wedged iCloud, but the argument does not depend on the stall's size — only on there being one.
- **A stalled asset goes to the back of the queue, not into a retry.** There are thousands of others and some fraction of them are in the fast mode.
- **The panel never estimates time remaining for a Photos fill.** The distribution is bimodal — the measured mean of 181.5 s described no fetch that actually happened. Progress is reported as a count.
- **A Photos photo enters the pool at scan time and the deck only once its bytes are cached.** The rule videos already follow. It deletes the skip-and-re-deal machinery, and gives the deck the invariant that everything in it can be served now.
- **A dealt card that cannot be served burns its place in the pass.** It is not returned. Gating deck membership on the cache keeps that population near zero, which is what makes burning affordable.
- **Listing and counting are separate operations, and the count arrives late.** Listing the collections is milliseconds; counting them is 34 seconds. So the route answers with names at once and a `count` that is absent until a background pass fills it, cached for the agent's lifetime. The panel already re-reads on a timer, so numbers appearing thirty seconds later need no push and no new mechanism.
- **A count is taken once per agent lifetime and then goes stale.** An album gaining photographs afterwards reads low until the next launch. Accepted: it is a number beside a name in a chooser, nothing the deck reads, and keeping it current means re-paying 34 seconds of round trips on a schedule.
- **A real library holds subtypes the SDK does not name.** Measured 2026-08-26: subtype 221 and the whole 1000000218–1000000220 range came back from a 439-collection library and appear nowhere in `PhotosTypes.h`. One of them is *Recently Saved*, holding 37,550 photographs. They are listed as `.otherSmartAlbum` under Utilities rather than matched on their raw values, because an undeclared number is an unowned one and a constant matching it would fail silently the day Apple moved it.
- **Hidden and the whole library are never offered by a picker.** Syd, 2026-10-10, of the Mac's picker and the Widgets app's: "neither one should have `Hidden`", and "anything that has the `wholeLibrary` tag should be excluded"; the second is the collection PhotoKit titles *Recents*. They are the two exceptions to the line below, and each is left out by its kind, where the sections are made (`LibrarySectionGroup.grouped`). A source of either kind chosen before then stays in the Settings list until it is removed there. `Plans/PGR Widgets - iOS.md`.
- **Nothing else is hidden from the picker, including smart albums this build has no opinion about.** The allowlist this plan once proposed is gone. A collection somebody can see in Photos and not here is a bug they cannot diagnose, and the sections plus an honest count already say which ones are worth choosing — a video-only smart album reads `0`.
- **The album list is not counted by fetch on every request.** 439 collections cost 34 seconds, at a flat ~78 ms each regardless of size, and `estimatedAssetCount` is `NSNotFound` for every smart album. Neither documented route survives this library.
- **The allowlist has a size test as well as a usefulness test.** At ~3 MB an original, Favorites is 25 GB against a 10 GB ceiling and Recents is 288 GB. Nothing in the library fits, so every Photos album churns the cache — accepted, though **corrected on the second run**: that churn costs disk, not latency, because a Photos eviction is a 3 ms re-materialize and not a network fetch. **The ceiling is 1 GB since 2026-09-06**, which does not change the conclusion — it was already true that nothing fits — but it does make the size test measure a ratio nobody should read as close.
- **`requestData`, cancelled on its first chunk, is the availability probe.** 13.9 ms median, and right about all six assets that were then fetched. `PHImageResultIsInCloudKey` answers about a rendition rather than the original resource, and disagreed 3 times in 45 across two albums — every one in the same direction.
- **A `PhotoLibrary` seam, mirroring `FileAccess`.** PhotoKit cannot be exercised in a unit test without a real library and a TCC grant, so the provider's logic goes behind a protocol and the PhotoKit binding stays thin enough to read in one sitting.
- **Albums and smart albums only, for now.** Favorites is a smart album, so the kind the user actually asks for is covered. Pinned assets and a whole-library source are additions rather than completions, and both are argued below.
- **Photos gets its own panel above the file-backed list. Reversed 2026-08-26.** The argument for one list was that sections are a rework of rows that already work. What changed is the realisation that there is exactly one Photos library and there always will be, so this was never a *section* of a list of sources — it is one standing statement of which collections are in play. That shape costs nothing the old argument was protecting: no multiple selection, no second `+` and `−`, no batch `DELETE`. It also gives authorization somewhere permanent to live, which a picker that exists only while it is open cannot.
- **The picker is an outline, not four flat lists. Decided 2026-08-26.** Photos has real nested folders, and flattening them was what made 31 titles in a 439-collection library indistinguishable. Folders nest inside their section, folders sort before albums at each level, and an album's place in the tree says where it lives instead of a path repeated on every row.
- **Folders carry three-state checkboxes, and a folder is never a source.** It holds albums rather than photographs, so the checkbox summarises what is beneath it and is derived every time — there is no folder state stored anywhere to drift. A mixed folder fills rather than empties, which is the platform convention.
- **Favorites is pinned above the headings.** It is an album by every technical measure and is not one by any other, and Photos puts it above its sidebar sections too. Library and Recents have the same argument and have not been moved: ticking Library is 95,904 photographs in one click, which should not be made easy by accident.
- **No search field. Tried, built, and dropped 2026-08-26.** Collapsing the three sections you are not looking in does the same job with a control that is there for its own reasons.
- **The picker groups collections into four sections, matching Photos' own sidebar.** Albums, Sharing, Media Types, Utilities. Three was the first instinct and it buries Live Photos, Panoramas and Screenshots under Utilities, which is not where anybody looks for them — and *Live Photos* is the album the spike was run against.
- **Counts in the picker are images only**, matching what would actually be served. They will not agree with the numbers Photos shows for a collection holding videos, and the video-only smart albums read `0`.
- **One photograph is one row across collections.** Overlap is the normal case once checking boxes is easy — a photograph is in Recents, in Favorites, and in its album. `SchemaV9` deduplicates on `localIdentifier` at intake; see `PLAN.md`, *One photograph, one row*.
- **Watching is separable and is held.** `PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver` is Phase 3 work in `PLAN.md`, but it is a change to how the pool *notices*, not to how a source is added, and folding it in would mean two unproven mechanisms failing at once.

# Background

`PLAN.md` Phase 3 asks for the Apple Photos provider alongside the Mac app's window, and asks for a spike first: confirm `PHAssetResourceManager` returns true originals for iCloud-optimized assets, and measure throughput. Nothing about it has been built. The kit imports Foundation and nothing else.

The scaffolding, however, is all there and has been since the first commit. `SourceKind.photosCollection` and `.photosAsset` exist as constants. `SchemaV1`'s comments name `PHAssetCollection` and `PHAsset` identifiers as things `locator` and `external_id` will hold. `SourceProvider` is `async` on both operations specifically because PhotoKit suspends and the folder provider does not — the doc comment says so. `SourceStore.EditFailure.unsupportedKind` names "a Photos album, today" as the case it exists for. The agent's bundle script carries the usage string. What is missing is one provider and the branch that lets a non-path source through the door.

The app is a client and stays one: it reads `servicePort` from preferences, asks the agent, and draws the answer. It is unsandboxed and links the kit, which is why it can answer *where a folder source stands* without a round trip — and precisely why it cannot answer the same question about an album, which `MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md` records as the reason the source endpoint is not going away.

# Detailed discussions

## What Phase 1 measured

_Three runs, 2026-08-25, against a 95,901-photo library on one Mac: `-n 6` at 16:42; `-n 6 --probe 30` five hours later at 22:12; and `-n 1 --probe 10 --album "Live Photos"` at 22:19. Small samples, one library, one connection, one day; read every number that way. What is **not** yet measured is listed at the end._

### The exit gate is met

Every one of the six written files matched the pixel dimensions its `PHAsset` reported, **including the five that had to be downloaded**. `PHAssetResourceManager.writeData` returns true originals for iCloud-optimized assets, which is the claim the whole design rests on and the one that could have invalidated it. The fallback to `PHImageManager.requestImageDataAndOrientation` is not needed.

### `.readOnly` authorization does not exist

`PHAccessLevel` has two values, `PHAccessLevelAddOnly = 1` and `PHAccessLevelReadWrite = 2`. There is no read-only level: `.addOnly` grants saving into the library and nothing else, so reading an album at all requires `.readWrite`. The Design Decision that said otherwise could not be implemented as written. `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` remains the right key, and the usage string is the only place the asymmetry can be explained to the person being asked.

### A command-line tool cannot raise a TCC prompt without an embedded `Info.plist`

The first attempt to run the spike returned `denied` **instantly, with no prompt**, which on a console is indistinguishable from a user clicking Don't Allow. A bare Mach-O carries no `Info.plist` and therefore no usage string, and TCC refuses rather than prompting. `Package.swift` now `-sectcreate`s one into `__TEXT,__info_plist`.

The responsible-process question is sharper than this plan anticipated. TCC attributes the request to whatever launched the tool, so the grant lands on Terminal — or on whatever other application's shell it was run from, which in practice made the difference between the request being promptable and not. The Phase 4 check against the installed agent bundle is not a formality.

### Listing albums costs half a minute, and the cost is per album

439 collections took **34,005 ms** to count, and **31,392 ms** on the second run five hours later — so this reproduces, and it is a property of the library rather than of a moment. The cost is flat and has nothing to do with album size:

| collection | photos | counted in |
|---|---|---|
| Recents | 95,901 | 116.8 ms |
| Favorites | 8,477 | 31.3 ms |
| any `albumRegular` | 1 to 3,071 | ~78–90 ms |
| any `albumCloudShared` | 10 to 4,804 | ~50 ms |
| most smart albums | — | 2–6 ms |

A one-photograph album costs 80.6 ms and a 95,901-photograph album costs 116.8 ms, so this is not a scan. It is a fixed toll paid ~440 times, which points at a round trip rather than computation.

**And the documented cheap answer is unavailable exactly where it is needed.** `PHAssetCollection.estimatedAssetCount` returned `NSNotFound` for *every* smart album — Recents, Favorites, Live Photos, all of them — and a usable number only for `albumRegular` and `albumCloudShared`. Favorites is the album a person actually asks for, and it is in the half with no estimate.

So `GET /v2/photos/albums` cannot count on demand by either documented route. Whatever Phase 4 does, it is not this — and what it did is *The service surfaces*, below: list on demand, count in the background.

### Enumeration is lazy on the fetch and not on the walk

```
fetch  111.6 ms    footprint 23.1 MB   (+0 bytes)
walk   3,281.4 ms  footprint 165.7 MB  (+142.7 MB)  · 95,901 assets
```

`PHAsset.fetchAssets` returns in milliseconds and costs nothing, exactly as documented and as `PLAN.md`'s *Cold start* assumes. Walking the result retained **142.7 MB** — about 1.5 kB per asset — and did not give it back.

It scales linearly and reproduces: 141.5 MB over 95,901 assets is 1.48 kB each, and a separate walk of the 6,898-asset Live Photos album retained 12.1 MB, or 1.75 kB each. This is per-asset retention, not a fixed cost.

This lands on `PLAN.md` rather than on this document. The constant-memory scanner does not survive a full walk of a large album as written. Whether the retention is `PHFetchResult`'s own object cache or undrained autoreleased objects is **not measured**, and the two have different fixes: batched `enumerateObjects` over index ranges in the first case, a drain per batch in the second. Guessing between them is exactly what a spike exists to prevent.

### The resource-selection rule holds, and the trap is not the one named

In an ordinary album:

```
edited     .photo (014_14.JPG) · .adjustmentData (Adjustments.plist) · .fullSizePhoto (FullSizeRender.jpeg)
unedited   .photo (IMG_0023.JPG)
```

`.fullSizePhoto` appeared only alongside `.adjustmentData`, so it does track a real edit.

A third run aimed at the `smartAlbumLivePhotos` album reached the case the rule most needed to survive. An **edited** Live Photo carries five resources, two of them QuickTime movies, in this order:

```
.photo                public.heic                 IMG_2650.HEIC
.adjustmentData       com.apple.property-list     Adjustments.plist
.pairedVideo          com.apple.quicktime-movie   IMG_2650.MOV
.fullSizePairedVideo  com.apple.quicktime-movie   FullSizeRender.mov
.fullSizePhoto        public.heic                 FullSizeRender.heic
```

An **unedited** one carries two, `.photo` (`IMG_3309.JPG`) and `.pairedVideo` (`IMG_3309.MOV`).

The rule picks correctly — the pull returned `.fullSizePhoto`, 1.7 MB, 4032×3024, matching the asset's dimensions — but **the hazard this document names is the wrong one**. `.pairedVideo` is easy to avoid. `.fullSizePairedVideo` is not:

- It sits **immediately before** `.fullSizePhoto`, so scanning for a "full size" variant and taking the first match yields the movie.
- It is named **`FullSizeRender.mov`** against the photo's **`FullSizeRender.heic`**, so a filename heuristic yields the movie too.
- Two of the five resources are movies, and the one that most resembles what we want is one of them.

Matching on exact `PHAssetResourceType` is the only formulation that survives this. The symptom of getting it wrong is the one this document already describes — photographs vanishing three deals at a time — and the near-miss is far closer than "never `.pairedVideo`" implies.

**Originals are a mix of HEIC and JPEG.** `.photo` was `public.heic` on the edited asset and `public.jpeg` on the unedited one, so the cache holds both. `CGImageSource` read the HEIC without special handling, which the dimension check confirms.

### `writeData` streams

| file | peak footprint | retained |
|---|---|---|
| 76 kB | +246 kB | +246 kB |
| 596 kB | 0 | −49 kB |
| 1.9 MB | 0 | 0 |
| 2.7 MB | +49 kB | +49 kB |
| 2.9 MB | 0 | 0 |
| 3.4 MB | +16 kB | +16 kB |

Across a 45× range of file sizes the footprint does not follow the file. A 2.9 MB original was written with **no measurable change at all**. The 246 kB against the first pull is `PHAssetResourceManager` waking up for the first time in the process, which is why the verdict excludes the first pull — the spike's original rule judged on the worst *ratio*, which is dominated by fixed costs on the smallest file, and it duly reported "buffered" against data that says the opposite.

The second run, with every asset local, is cleaner still: **the largest write moved the footprint by nothing at all while writing 3.4 MB** — 0.000× the file, and zero was also the worst of any write in the run.

`PLAN.md`'s case for `PHAssetResourceManager` over `requestImageDataAndOrientation` — that a large original is never held whole in the agent's address space — holds, and now holds on evidence from both directions: the streaming write costs nothing, and the alternative was measured costing 3.6 MB.

One incidental confirmation. A 596 kB original reported **full resolution (rotated)**: 3264×2448 written against an asset reporting the axes the other way round. The spike counts a swap as a match, and without that it would have been flagged as a downscale and chased.

Peak footprint across the whole run was 172.2 MB, essentially all of it the enumeration walk above rather than anything the writes did.

### iCloud latency does not follow file size — and the stall was iCloud, not PhotoKit

**Explained on 2026-08-26, and the explanation retires three decisions below.** The spike was re-run against the same library one day later, with iCloud healthy:

| | 2026-08-25 | 2026-08-26 |
|---|---|---|
| min | 1.5 s | **0.5 s** |
| median | 301.5 s | **0.8 s** |
| max | 301.6 s | **1.0 s** |
| mean | 181.5 s | **0.7 s** |

Five downloads, 9.7 MB in 3.62 s, and **no fetch anywhere near the 300-second toll**. The fixed stall is not a property of PhotoKit, of iCloud-optimized assets, or of this library. It was a machine whose iCloud had gradually wedged itself — the same wedge that had an iCloud Drive *folder* source timing out all that evening and drove the whole source-benching design.

What reproduced exactly is the cost that governs the picker: counting 439 collections took **33,504 ms** against the previous day's 34,005 ms. That number is real, stable, and is why listing and counting are separate operations.

**What this does not retire.** Deadlines, off-pool fetching, and exponential source benching answer a hostile provider, and a provider does not stop being able to behave badly because one day's measurements were clean. What changes is a constant, not a mechanism — see *No materialize timeout below 305 seconds*, which no longer has the evidence it was written from.

The original measurements are kept below, because the day they describe was real and the design that came out of it is still carrying weight.


| file | pixels | elapsed |
|---|---|---|
| 76 kB | 640×480 | 301,456.5 ms |
| 3.4 MB | 3504×2336 | 301,588.4 ms |
| 2.7 MB | 2336×3504 | 1,530.2 ms |

Across all five downloads — 11.5 MB in 907.5 s, min 1.5 s, median 301.5 s, max 301.6 s — the outcomes are **bimodal, not distributed**: approximately 1.5 s, 1.4 s, 301.5 s, 301.5 s, 301.6 s. Nothing lands in between, and the slow mode is the fast mode plus 300.0 s to within a tenth of a second. Three of five fetches paid it.

So the picture is a ~1.5 s transfer with a fixed five-minute stall in front of it, taken or not taken. `writeData`'s `progressHandler` on the slow ones reported 70% and 90% in the same second the transfer completed: dead wait, then an instant transfer.

**The aggregate rate is meaningless and should never be quoted.** "13 kB/s across five assets" describes the stall, not the network; when bytes actually move they move at ~1.8 MB/s.

**What decides whether a fetch pays the toll is not established**, and it is now the most consequential open question in this plan, because it is the difference between a first fill of hours and one of weeks:

| assumption | Favorites, 8,477 originals, serial |
|---|---|
| every fetch fast (1.5 s) | ~3.5 hours |
| measured mean (181.5 s) | ~17.8 days |

Candidates, none tested: that the stall is shared rather than per-asset; that it is an artifact of an unbundled process talking to `cloudphotod`; that the preceding `isNetworkAccessAllowed = false` probe provokes it; or that `requestData` behaves differently from `writeData` here.

One of them can be argued down from the data already in hand. The slow fetches were not front-loaded — the first download paid the toll, the second ran in 1.5 s, and slow ones recurred after it. A shared resource waking up would produce one slow fetch and then a fast tail. **The stall is per-asset, not per-session.**

**Decided: the cause is not pursued.** Divining it would mean instrumenting somebody else's daemon to explain behaviour that may not survive the next OS release, and the design has to tolerate the stall whether or not we understand it. It is recorded as a constraint, and the Design Decisions above are what tolerating it costs:

- no timeout below 305 s, because a shorter one converts the slow mode into a failure;
- `requestData`, because a bound on an uncancellable `writeData` buys back only our own control;
- more than one fetch in flight, so a stalled asset does not idle the source;
- stalled assets to the back of the queue rather than into a retry;
- and no time estimates anywhere, because the mean of a bimodal distribution describes neither mode.

What makes all of this survivable is a decision taken before the stall was known about: deck membership is gated on the bytes being cached, so nothing a person is looking at ever waits on a fetch.

The classification probe itself works. `isNetworkAccessAllowed = false` succeeded in 2.6 ms on a genuinely local asset and failed in about 2.5 s on a remote one, so the two-call scheme in *Classifying without private API* is sound.

**Downloads persist.** An asset fetched in one run came back `local` in 2.6 ms in the next, which means the spike is not repeatable in the direction that matters: re-running over the same album converges to all-local and the latency figures evaporate.

### Photos retains downloaded originals, and our cache is a second copy

The second run re-pulled the identical six assets five hours later. **Every one came back local, at full resolution, in 1.8–3.7 ms** — including a 5712×4284 original. Photos keeps what it downloads, and keeps the original rather than a derivative, which was the failure mode that would have been easiest to miss.

The probe's wider sample is the control, and it rules out the obvious confound. The Mac's own wallpaper and screensaver were running from Photos throughout those five hours, so "all six are local" could have meant the system had warmed the library generally. It had not:

- **8 of 35 assets already here, 27 in iCloud.**
- Six of those eight are the ones we downloaded.
- So of the 29 nobody has touched, **two are local — about 7%**, against 100% of the six we fetched.

Retention is ours, not ambient. Incidentally that 7% is also the first honest estimate of how cloud-optimized this library is, and it makes first fill a mostly-download proposition rather than a mixed one.

**This corrects a Design Decision made earlier the same day.** Eviction from *our* cache does not cost a network fetch, because Photos still has the original; it costs a 3 ms re-materialize. The churn argument behind the allowlist's size test survives only as an argument about disk space.

### Retention reopened the storage decision, and it was upheld

*Storage is always `.materialized`* was decided before any of this was measured, on the reasoning that a Photos asset's bytes are ours only once copied. The retention finding genuinely complicates that: if Photos holds the original locally and hands it over in single-digit milliseconds, a Photos asset resembles a `.referenced` file — bytes that live elsewhere, cheaply checked, fetched when wanted — more than it resembles something that must be copied. Not copying would save a second copy of a 25 GB album.

**Decided: we copy anyway, and the double storage cost is worth paying.** The reasons, in the order they matter:

**Photos' retention is not a promise.** "Optimize Mac Storage" evicts local originals under disk pressure, with no notification and no change to the asset's identifier. A `.referenced` Photos source could therefore go dark in bulk at a moment of the system's choosing — the same shape of failure as the library switch that `.offline` exists for, but arriving quietly and partially.

**It would put the probe in the serving path.** Deck membership is gated on the bytes being cached precisely so that everything in the deck can be served now. If the bytes are Photos' rather than ours, that invariant becomes a 13.9 ms question asked per deal, on an answer that can have changed since enumeration — which is the skip-and-re-deal machinery this plan already deleted once.

**Renderings have to be cached regardless.** The cache exists for them whatever happens to originals, so `.referenced` would not remove a mechanism, only shrink what passes through it.

**`.referenced` means something narrower than "the bytes exist somewhere".** In `PLAN.md` it means a stable path on a volume that can be `stat`ed. A Photos local identifier is not that, and stretching the mode to cover it would put a second meaning inside one storage value.

The cost is real and should be stated plainly: a 25 GB Favorites album occupies about 25 GB in the Photos library and, against the byte ceiling — 10 GB when this was written, **1 GB since 2026-09-06** — fills our cache outright with the rest churning through. That makes the allowlist's size test load-bearing rather than cautionary, and it is the strongest argument this plan has for a Photos source needing a reserved cache floor.

**And the ceiling stopped being the interesting number when the cache stopped being a prediction.** Under *The resize cache is removed* the cache is a staging area for the queue, sized at twice its working set, so *no* album was ever going to fit and the ratio above is not a fit test — it is a statement about how much re-materializing a Photos source does, which the 3 ms measurement already says is cheap. The reserved-floor argument survives on its own terms and is not strengthened by the smaller number.

### The availability probe, measured

Thirty-five assets, both probes on each:

| probe | median | what it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `requestData`, cancelled on first chunk | **13.9 ms** | is the original resource here |
| `requestImageDataAndOrientation` | 4.9 ms | is *a rendition* here |

`requestData` was right about every asset subsequently fetched. Across two albums the two probes disagreed **3 times in 45**, every one in the same direction: `requestData` found the original present while `PHImageResultIsInCloudKey` was set. That is the rendition-versus-resource distinction showing up in real data, and it decides the choice.

The rate was higher in the Live Photos album — 2 of 10 against 1 of 35 — which is what one would expect if a Live Photo's components can differ in availability, the still being here while the paired video is not. That would make `PHImageManager`'s answer true about the asset and useless to us, since the only resource we ever fetch is the still. The probe asking about the resource we would actually take is not incidental to the choice; it is the whole of it.

Extrapolated at 13.9 ms:

| album | assets | probing cost |
|---|---|---|
| Favorites | 8,477 | ~2 minutes |
| Recents | 95,901 | ~22 minutes |

Affordable for an agent on a timer, impossible for a picker, which is the same shape as every other per-asset cost here.

The cheaper probe also put a number on the thing `PLAN.md` rejected it for: **`requestImageDataAndOrientation` held up to 3.6 MB of a single asset in our address space**. On a local asset it hands back the whole original as `Data`. Real, and measured.

### Subtypes this document does not know about

Six subtypes fell outside the documented enumeration, two of them large:

| raw | name | photos |
|---|---|---|
| 1000000218 | Recently Saved | 37,550 |
| 1000000220 | Captured by Me | 8,797 |
| 219 | Spatial | 0 |
| 220 | Screen Recordings | 0 |
| 1000000219 | Recovered | 0 |
| 221 | Dual Capture | 0 |

The allowlist has to say something about the first two, and cannot do it by naming a `PHAssetCollectionSubtype` case that does not exist in the SDK.

### Album titles are not unique

"VHS Band 2024-2025" exists twice — once `albumRegular` at 3,071 photographs and once `albumCloudShared` at 4,804 — and a dozen other titles repeat the same way. The Phase 5 picker will show visible duplicates with nothing to tell them apart, and any lookup by title silently takes the first match.

### The cache ceiling is an allowlist constraint

At roughly 3 MB an original — thin, from this run's two largest files — against the 10 GB `byteCeiling` in force when this was measured. **The cache stopped holding renderings on 2026-09-06**, so the estimate is no longer low on that count; the ceiling is now 1 GB, against which every row below is worse by a further order of magnitude:

| album | photos | originals |
|---|---|---|
| Favorites | 8,477 | ~25 GB |
| Captured by Me | 8,797 | ~26 GB |
| Recently Saved | 37,550 | ~113 GB |
| Recents | 95,901 | ~288 GB |

Nothing fits — the curated albums are two and a half times the ceiling as measured, twenty-five times the 1 GB ceiling in force now, and the smart albums an order of magnitude past that — and under cache-gated deck membership an album that cannot fit thrashes: download, deal, evict, download again. **Deck membership is no longer cache-gated** — see *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards* — so that particular thrash is structural rather than possible: the deck deals over the whole library and the queue fetches what it dealt, whatever the ceiling. For a folder source an eviction costs a millisecond re-read; for a Photos source the second run measured a 3 ms re-materialize rather than the network fetch the first run assumed, so the churn costs disk, not latency. The largest offender is `smartAlbumUserLibrary`, which this document already excludes on other grounds.

### A Swift 6 trap the provider will hit

The second run crashed on its first probe, before any of the above existed to be measured: `dispatch_assert_queue` → `_swift_task_checkIsolatedSwift`, inside `PHAssetResourceRequest`'s data handler.

PhotoKit invokes these blocks on a dispatch queue of its own. Written as bare closures inside actor-isolated code, against block parameters the importer does not mark sendable, Swift infers them as isolated to the enclosing actor and emits an isolation assertion into each — which trips the moment PhotoKit calls back off-main. A hard crash on the first chunk of the first fetch, not a warning.

`PhotosCollectionSourceProvider` will live in `PhotoGoRoundKit`, which builds in Swift 6 language mode, and will call these same APIs from isolated code. **No test against a fake `PhotoLibrary` would catch it**, because a fake never delivers a callback from a dispatch queue. The fix is to annotate each handler's type `@Sendable` explicitly, which removes the inference rather than suppressing the check. Which imported blocks the compiler happens to treat as sendable is not something to rely on: `writeData`'s single completion never tripped it and `requestData`'s two-block form did.

### Still unmeasured

_The 300-second stall is deliberately not on this list. Its distribution is measured and its cause is closed as a constraint rather than a question — see above._

- **Whether the walk's per-asset retention is a fetch-result cache or undrained autoreleases.** Confirmed linear across two album sizes; the mechanism is still a guess, and the two have different fixes.
- **Everything about TCC from the installed agent bundle**, which is Phase 4's and was always going to be.
- **How long Photos' retention lasts.** Five hours, confirmed. What "Optimize Mac Storage" does to it under real disk pressure is the question a `.referenced` design would rest on.

## Why the spike is the whole of the first phase

`PLAN.md` asks for two things before the provider is written, and they are not the same question.

The first is **whether we can get originals at all**. `PHAssetResourceManager.writeData(for:toFile:options:)` with `isNetworkAccessAllowed = true` is documented to stream the original resource to a file. What is not documented, and what has burned people, is what comes back for an asset whose full-resolution copy lives in iCloud and whose local copy is a downscaled derivative. The failure mode is quiet: you get a file, it is a valid JPEG, it opens, and it is 2048 pixels wide instead of 8064. Nothing in the pipeline downstream would notice — the renderer would happily produce a 1000×1000 thumbnail from it, the cache would store it, and the window would show a slightly soft picture. So the check has to be made explicitly, at the one place where the truth is knowable.

The comparison to make is the written file's `CGImageSource` pixel dimensions against `PHAsset.pixelWidth` and `PHAsset.pixelHeight`, which the asset reports without any fetch. Equal means we got the original. Smaller means the design in `PLAN.md`'s *Getting full-resolution originals out of Photos* does not hold and the fallback — `PHImageManager.requestImageDataAndOrientation` with `.highQualityFormat` and `.version(.original)`, which returns `Data` and therefore reintroduces the address-space problem the whole approach exists to avoid — has to be weighed.

The second is **throughput**, and the number that matters is not an average. A library where a third of the assets are optimized behaves completely differently from one where none are, and averaging the two produces a figure that describes neither. So the spike classifies before it measures.

### Classifying without private API

There is no public "is this asset locally available". `PHAssetResource` has a `locallyAvailable` value that is only reachable through `value(forKey:)`, which is private API by another name and not something to build on.

The public probe is better anyway, because it measures the thing rather than asking about it: attempt `writeData` with `PHAssetResourceRequestOptions.isNetworkAccessAllowed = false`. If it succeeds, the asset was local, and the elapsed time is the local read. If it fails, the asset was optimized; retry with `true`, and the elapsed time is the download. One classification and two timings out of two calls, with no guessing.

This also incidentally tests the option that the provider will depend on. If `isNetworkAccessAllowed = false` does *not* fail on an optimized asset — if it silently hands back the derivative instead — that is a far more important finding than the throughput numbers, because it means the flag is not the guard we think it is and every materialize needs a dimension check of its own.

### The edited-photo question, which `PLAN.md` leaves open

*Getting full-resolution originals out of Photos* records the cost of `PHAssetResourceManager` honestly: it gives the original, not the edited render, so a photo cropped in Photos comes back uncropped. It proposes `.fullSizePhoto` when present with a fallback to `.photo`, and says explicitly that this "needs the Photos provider's spike to measure it against a real library."

So the spike prints, for a photograph known to have been edited, the full resource list with type, UTI, and — after writing each — bytes and dimensions. Three things become visible at once: whether `.fullSizePhoto` is present for an edited asset and absent for an unedited one, whether it is the edited render or something else, and whether it is full resolution or a display-sized convenience. The answer decides the provider's resource-selection rule, and it is two lines of code once known and an afternoon of guessing until then.

There is a subtlety worth stating: `.fullSizePhoto` is the adjusted render, but `.adjustmentData` is what actually indicates an edit exists. An asset can carry `.fullSizePhoto` for reasons other than a user edit. Printing the whole list rather than probing for one type is what keeps this honest.

### Live Photos

A Live Photo is `mediaType == .image` with `.photoLive` in its subtypes, so it passes the image predicate — correctly, since it *is* a photograph with a movie attached. Its resource list contains both a `.photo` (or `.fullSizePhoto`) and a `.pairedVideo`, and possibly `.fullSizePairedVideo`.

Taking the wrong one is not a subtle failure. It writes a `.mov` into the cache under a key the renderer will hand to `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex`, which returns nil, which retires the photo after three attempts as unrenderable — so the symptom is *photographs quietly disappearing from the library*, three deals at a time, with a log line about a render failure and nothing pointing at Live Photos. Printing the resource list in the spike costs nothing and makes the rule obvious before it can be got wrong.

### Peak footprint, and why it is in the spike rather than assumed

The claim that justifies `PHAssetResourceManager` over `requestImageDataAndOrientation` is that it streams to a file and never holds the resource in memory. That claim is the reason a 100 MB ProRAW is not a 100 MB `Data` in the agent's address space, and it has never been tested here.

Sampling `phys_footprint` from `task_vm_info` across the run costs about a dozen lines and turns the claim into a measurement. What we want to see is a footprint that does not track the largest file pulled. What would be alarming is a peak that rises with file size, which would mean the write is buffered somewhere and the memory discipline the whole scanner was built around does not survive the Photos provider.

The folder provider's enumeration has an equivalent story already recorded in its own comments — 94 MB across 80,000 files against 12 MB, and the fix that removed the allocation rather than draining it. That number exists because somebody measured. This is the same discipline applied to the one operation whose memory behaviour is a library dependency rather than our own code.

### Enumeration laziness

`PLAN.md`'s *Cold start* asserts that `PHAsset.fetchAssets` is lazy, and the whole constant-memory scanner design depends on that being true for a hundred-thousand-asset library. `PHFetchResult` is documented to fetch lazily, and in practice it does — but "in practice it does" is what the spike is for.

The check: fetch the largest album, sample the footprint immediately after the fetch returns and again after enumerating every object, and time both. A fetch that returns in milliseconds with a flat footprint and an enumeration that costs the time is the answer we want. A fetch that takes seconds and moves the footprint means `PHFetchResult` materialized, and the provider needs a different enumeration strategy — most likely `enumerateObjects` with a batched range rather than index access.

## TCC, and the thing the spike cannot answer

Two processes, two bundles, and only one of them ever touches the library. That is settled and this plan does not reopen it. What it does have to name is that **the spike runs in the wrong process on purpose**, and what that costs.

`pgr_ctl` invoked from a terminal is not a bundle. TCC attributes its Photos request to the responsible process, which is Terminal — so the prompt says Terminal would like to access your photos, the grant lands on Terminal, and `com.sydpolk.photogoround.server` is not mentioned. For the measurements this is irrelevant: PhotoKit does not care which bundle got the grant, only that one did. For the *product* it is the entire question, and the spike answers none of it.

That is the right trade for Phase 1. Reaching the numbers quickly is the point, and the numbers are what could invalidate the design. But it means a separate check belongs to Phase 4 rather than being assumed away: run the same authorization request from the installed `Photo-Go-Round Server.app`, launched by launchd, and confirm the prompt names the server bundle and that the grant persists across a rebuild. That last part is the one with a real trap in it — TCC records the grant against the code signature, and `make-agent-bundle.sh` defaulted to ad-hoc signing, which produces a *different* signature on every build. *That script is deleted; the same trap applies to any DerivedData build, which is re-signed every time, and is why an Archive moved to `/Applications` is the stable identity.* A grant given to one ad-hoc build will not necessarily be honoured for the next, and the symptom is the Photos prompt reappearing, or worse, an agent that silently reports unavailable after a rebuild. The script already warns about this in its `--sign` help text. It is worth confirming rather than trusting.

There is a further wrinkle in the same family. A launchd agent with `ProcessType Background` and `LSUIElement` raising a TCC prompt is a legitimate thing to do, but the prompt arrives with no window behind it to explain itself. `MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md`'s TCC section already worked out the answer for folders — the picker buys timing, and a prompt two seconds after the user chose something in a dialog is legible where an unprompted one is baffling. The same shape applies here, and it is why authorization is a `POST` triggered by the app's Allow button rather than something the agent does at launch or on its own initiative. `PLAN.md`'s *Photos is optional, and there is exactly one of it* is explicit: `requestAuthorization` is called when a Photos source is added, never at launch and never speculatively, and a user who never adds one never sees the prompt.

## What the provider actually does, per operation

### enumerate

Fetch the collection by local identifier via `PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections(withLocalIdentifiers:options:)`. An empty result is the library-switch case, not an empty album — return `.unavailable` and let the source go dark as a unit, which is what `PLAN.md` requires.

Then `PHAsset.fetchAssets(in:options:)` with `PHFetchOptions.predicate` set to `mediaType == PHAssetMediaType.image.rawValue`, and push each asset into the sink as a `DiscoveredPhoto`:

- `externalID` is `asset.localIdentifier`. It is library-scoped and not stable across devices, which `PLAN.md`'s *Why nothing syncs between devices* already accounts for; nothing here needs `PHCloudIdentifier`.
- `mediaType` is `.image` by construction.
- `storage` is `.materialized`, always. There is no file to point at.
- `byteSize` is `nil`. This deserves its own note, below.

The sink contract — never build a collection of the whole source — is satisfied naturally by a `PHFetchResult` walk, provided the laziness check passes.

### The byte-size problem

`DiscoveredPhoto.byteSize` is `Int64?`, and for a Photos asset the honest answer at enumeration time is nil. `PHAsset` does not report a byte size. `PHAssetResource` has `value(forKey: "fileSize")`, which is private API. The only public way to learn the size is to fetch the resource, which is the expensive thing enumeration exists not to do.

Nil is therefore correct rather than lazy, and the question is what depends on it. The cache is bounded by bytes, so the byte accounting has to be right somewhere — but it is right at *materialize* time, where `MaterializedFile` carries the actual size of the file we wrote. What a nil at enumeration costs is the ability to predict, before fetching, how much a source will occupy. Nothing in the current design uses that prediction. Worth confirming during Phase 2 that no path treats a nil `byteSize` as zero in a way that matters to eviction; if one does, that is a bug the folder provider can also hit, on a file whose resource values could not be read.

### existence

Fetch by local identifier. A result means present, an empty result means absent — with one caveat that decides the whole answer: **an empty result also means the library was switched.** Distinguishing them is what `availability` is for, and `SourceProvider`'s contract already handles this correctly. `existence` returns `.absent` and the scanner then asks `availability`; if the source says it cannot be reached, the removal does not happen.

`.unknown` is returned only when authorization is not granted, which is a genuine claim about reachability rather than about effort. The doc comment on `existence` is unusually pointed about this — answering `.unknown` when the truth is `.absent` shows the photo, and some reasons a person deletes a photograph are not benign.

**Amended 2026-09-07: `.unknown` is also the answer when the album does not resolve.** The paragraph above assumed the only way for an identifier to fail against a readable library was a switch, which `availability` catches. A rebuild is the other way: Photos renumbered two albums and every asset in them, the library stayed readable, `availability` said offline, and `existence` — never having looked at the album — said `.absent` for each cached photograph as it came up to be shown, and deleted it. So the collection is fetched first, and an empty result there is *unknown* with the same reason `availability` gives. `.absent` is only ever said when the library was readable *and the album resolved*. See `Missing Albums Plan.md`.

The latency budget is generous, and it is worth using. `PHAsset.fetchAssets(withLocalIdentifiers:)` is a local database query, so this is fast anyway — but the contract says take the time to be right, and if a future version of this needs a network round trip to answer honestly, it should take it.

### availability

Driven by `PHPhotoLibrary.authorizationStatus(for: .readOnly)`:

- `.authorized` — ask whether the collection still resolves. It does: `.available`. It does not: `.offline`, with a reason naming the library switch as the likely cause. **`.missing` rather than `.offline` since 2026-09-07**, a fourth case that everything serving, fetching, or dealing treats exactly as offline and that only the panel tells apart, because an album that is not in a readable library is the one kind of unavailable a person can remove or reconnect from there. See `Missing Albums Plan.md`.
- `.limited` — this is an iOS concept and macOS does not offer it, but it is expressible and the provider should not crash on it. Treat as `.available`, since a limited grant still returns whatever it returns.
- `.denied`, `.restricted` — `.offline`, with a reason that tells the user where to fix it.
- `.notDetermined` — `.offline`. Notably **not** a place to raise the prompt: `availability` is called from the scanner, on a timer, in a background process, and prompting from there is exactly the baffling unattributed prompt the design avoids.

`.gone` is never returned by this provider. That is deliberate and total. The only thing that would justify it is knowing an album was deleted while the library was demonstrably present and readable — and distinguishing that from a library switch requires knowing which library we are talking to, which `PLAN.md` says there is no public way to ask. So the expensive mistake is unavailable to us by construction, which is a good place to be.

That still held on 2026-09-07, and it was not enough on its own: the deletion this rule exists to prevent happened anyway, one photograph at a time, through `existence`. The two questions now agree — see the amendment under *existence* — and what happens to a missing album after that is `Missing Albums Plan.md`: it keeps serving from the cache, its unheld photographs are not dealt, and the panel names it with Remove and Reconnect.

### materialize

`PHAssetResourceManager.writeData(for:toFile:options:)`, with `isNetworkAccessAllowed = true`, into the destination the cache handed us. Resource selection follows whatever the spike settles — the working assumption is `.fullSizePhoto` if present, else `.photo`, and never anything else.

Two things the folder provider does not have to worry about:

**Cancellation and progress.** A network fetch of a 100 MB original over a slow connection is a long operation, and `PHAssetResourceRequestOptions` has a `progressHandler`. The queue filler has no notion of a partial fetch and does not need one, but a fetch that hangs indefinitely would occupy a filler slot forever. Whether that needs a timeout is a Phase 2 question, and the honest answer probably depends on the spike's downloaded-asset timings.

**The completion is a callback.** `writeData` is completion-based, so the provider bridges it with `withCheckedThrowingContinuation`. Straightforward, with the one classic trap: resuming twice if the completion is ever invoked more than once. Worth a defensive guard rather than a comment saying it should not happen.

## Admitting a source that is not a path

This is the only part of the work that is not additive, and it is worth being precise about how small it is.

`SourceStore.add` opens with `if let unsupported = requests.first(where: { !$0.kind.isFileBacked })` and throws. That guard was correct when there was no non-file provider and it is the wrong shape now — it asks "is this a path" when the question it means is "is there a provider for this". Replacing it with a check against the registered provider table both admits Photos and keeps the original protection: a kind with no provider is still refused rather than being accepted, never scanned, and reported unavailable forever, which is exactly what `EditFailure.unsupportedKind`'s doc comment says it exists to prevent.

`SourceRequest.resolve` is the more interesting one. It standardizes a path, `stat`s it, checks directory-ness against the requested kind, and appends a trailing slash. Every one of those is wrong for a collection identifier, and the trailing slash is actively harmful — `SourceSpec.init` applies the same rule (`kind == .file || locator.hasSuffix("/") ? locator : locator + "/"`), so an album identifier would be silently stored with a slash appended and would never again match what PhotoKit returns.

The shape that fits: `resolve` branches on whether the kind is file-backed, and for a Photos request validates by asking the provider whether the collection exists. That means `resolve` needs access to a provider, which today it does not have — it is a static function taking a `FileManager`. The least invasive version passes a validator closure, keeping `SourceRequest` free of any dependency on the provider table while `SourceStore.add` supplies one. The all-or-none rule is preserved either way, and it should be: an album identifier that no longer resolves is exactly the typo case the batch refusal exists for, and it names itself in the refusal.

`SourceSpec`'s normalization needs the same branch. The comment there explains the trailing slash as "one spelling, decided here" — the locator is the identity that preferences, reconciliation, and duplicate detection all match on as a bare string. That argument is entirely correct and applies just as much to a collection identifier; it simply means "one spelling" for a Photos source is *the identifier exactly as PhotoKit gave it*, with nothing appended.

### One thing to verify rather than assume

`PHAssetCollection.localIdentifier` has the form `UUID/L0/040` — it contains slashes. Nothing in the source pipeline should care, since a locator is an opaque string everywhere except where paths are constructed from it, and no path is constructed from a Photos locator. But the cache directory is named by the source's `uuid`, not its locator, so that is safe; and the HTTP member route is `/v1/sources/<uuid>`, also safe. The place to check is anywhere a locator reaches a URL or a filename by a route nobody remembered. Grep for it in Phase 3 rather than trusting this paragraph.

## The service surfaces, and why there are two of them

### Browsing

`GET /v2/photos/albums` returns what a picker needs. Nothing about it is a source — this is the library, not the library's configuration, which is why it is not under `/v2/sources`.

**Counting was the one cost, and it turned out to be prohibitive rather than merely notable.** This section used to say a fetch per album on every request "may not be" acceptable for several hundred albums, and to nominate `estimatedAssetCount` as the fallback. Phase 1 killed both: 439 collections cost 34 seconds at a flat ~78 ms apiece, and `estimatedAssetCount` is `NSNotFound` for *every* smart album — which is to say for Favorites, the one a person actually asks for.

So listing and counting are two operations. `PhotosCollectionCatalog` lists on demand, which is milliseconds, and counts in the background, one collection at a time, keeping what it learns for the agent's lifetime. The route answers immediately with names and whatever counts exist, plus `counted` and `total` so a client can say "still counting" without inferring it from the nulls. The first person to open a picker pays for the pass; an agent nobody opens one against never spends the 34 seconds at all.

**The allowlist is gone.** This section argued for one, on the grounds that `smartAlbumVideos` and its siblings can only ever be empty for us and that `smartAlbumAllHidden` should not be offered by omission. What replaced it is sections and an honest count: a video-only smart album appears under *Media Types* reading `0`, which says more than hiding it would, and Hidden appears under *Utilities* where Photos puts it. The governing reason is that a collection somebody can see in Photos and not here is a bug they cannot diagnose — including any subtype Apple adds after this ships, which arrives as `.otherSmartAlbum` and is listed rather than dropped.

### Authorization

`GET /v2/photos/authorization` reads the status and returns it, and asks nobody — there is a test that sets up a library where asking *would* grant and asserts the read still reports `notDetermined`, because a read that silently prompts is the unattributed prompt this whole design avoids. `POST` calls `PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(for: .readWrite)` and returns what the user decided. **`.readWrite`, not `.readOnly` as first written here** — that level does not exist; see *`.readOnly` authorization does not exist*.

`PhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization` is the only call in the project that can raise a prompt, which is why `authorization` beside it is read-only and says so in its own comment. It is also idempotent by PhotoKit's own rule: the prompt appears only while the status is `notDetermined`, so somebody who said no gets their refusal back rather than a second dialog. This route cannot become a way to nag, and there is a test holding it to that.

The `POST` is the interesting one, because it is a request that blocks on a human. The panel's spinner-and-lockout convention already covers this — any action that goes to the agent disables the controls until it lands — but a TCC prompt can sit unanswered indefinitely, and `SourceService` sets `timeoutInterval = 15`. So the app must either raise its timeout for this one request or treat a timeout as "still deciding" rather than as a failure. The second is better: it keeps the timeout honest for everything else, and "still deciding" is a real state the sheet can show.

A `POST` that is refused is not an error. It is an answer, and the sheet's job is to say where to change it — System Settings › Privacy & Security › Photos — rather than to report a failure. `PLAN.md`'s *Showing unavailability* has the governing principle: denial is a state to display, not an error to handle.

### `Wire.title`

`SourceService.Source.name` is `URL(filePath: locator).lastPathComponent`. For `A1B2C3D4-.../L0/040` that yields `040`, which is worse than showing the raw identifier because it looks like it might mean something.

So the wire grows a `title`: the leaf name for a file or folder, the collection's `localizedTitle` for an album. Computed by the agent, which is the only process that can ask PhotoKit what an album is called. The app's `name` becomes `title ?? <existing leaf logic>`, so an older agent talking to a newer panel still produces something readable rather than nothing.

There is a small consequence for `SourcesModel.state(of:)`, which already branches on `SourceKind(source.kind).isFileBacked` and returns the agent's stored answer for anything else. That branch is already correct for Photos and needs no change — worth noting only because it is the kind of thing that looks like it needs one.

## The panel, and what it became instead

**Rewritten 2026-08-26.** This section argued that Photos should join the single list as another row, and that sections were a separate piece of work not to be entangled with proving the provider. The reasoning was sound and the premise was wrong.

The premise was that a Photos source is *a source*, one of a growing list you add to. It is not. There is exactly one Photos library and there always will be, so what belongs in Settings is not a section of a list — it is one standing statement of which collections are in play, and a way to change it. Settings therefore has two panels: *Apple Photos* on top, holding the chosen collections comma-separated, the total photo count, and a `Select Collections…` button; and *Folders and Files* below, enclosing exactly what was already there.

That shape costs none of what the original argument was protecting. The upper panel has no rows, so there is no multiple selection, no second `+` and `−`, and no batch `DELETE` for the endpoint to grow. The lower list is unchanged apart from the predicate that fills it, which is now *everything that is not a Photos collection* rather than folders and files by name — so a kind the panel has not been taught about appears somewhere it can be seen and removed, instead of being configured and invisible.

What the new shape buys that the old one could not: **authorization has somewhere to live**. A picker that exists only while it is open has nowhere to say *this app has not been given access to your photo library*, and nowhere to put the button that asks. A permanent panel does.

`Configure` is still not offered for a Photos source, for the same reason it is not offered for a file — `canConfigureSelection` reads `selected?.isFolder == true`, and a collection has no options today. When it gets some, they belong in the upper panel rather than in the sheet.

One thing the picker does need that no existing picker does: it is the first dialog in this app that is not `NSOpenPanel`. Everything about the source panel so far has leaned on the system picker doing the work. An album list is ours to draw, and it is also the first place a person sees their own library inside this app, which makes it the first place presentation is visible. `FEATURES.md` already has the answer for how much effort that deserves: the visual language stays plain, and the screensaver is where presentation is the product.

## Apple provides no collection picker, and one thing that follows from it

Checked against the macOS 27.0 SDK on 2026-08-26, because "surely there is one" is the kind of assumption that costs a day.

- **`PHPickerResult` carries exactly two things**: `itemProvider` and `assetIdentifier`. Assets, never collections.
- **`PHPickerCapabilitiesCollectionNavigation` is not what its name suggests.** The header calls it *"the sidebar or the albums tab"* — it lets the person browse into an album; what comes back is still the photographs they picked.
- **Nothing else in PhotosUI is a chooser.** The remaining view controllers are shared-album creation, customization, and posting.
- **There is no `Duplicates` subtype** in `PHAssetCollectionSubtype` at all; the list runs to `Spatial` and `ScreenRecordings`. Photos' own Duplicates album cannot be offered even if it were wanted. It is also solving a different problem: it finds pictures that *resemble* each other — the same scene at two resolutions, an edited version beside its original — where this project deduplicates the same file reached by two routes and never compares images at all. See `PLAN.md`, *One photograph, one row*.

So the picker is ours to draw, which was already assumed. **The thing that follows is about a feature this plan excludes**: `PHPickerViewController` runs out of process and needs *no photo library authorization at all* — no TCC prompt, ever. For pinned individual assets (`SourceKind.photosAsset`) Apple's picker does the entire job for free, including the consent question. That does not make pinned assets more urgent, but it does mean their picker is not work, and the argument below against them should be read knowing it.

## What is deliberately excluded, and why each

**`PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver`.** `PLAN.md` puts watching in Phase 3 alongside `FSEventStream`, and it belongs there. It is excluded from *this* plan because it changes how the pool notices a change, not how a source is added, and the two failure modes look nothing alike — a provider that materializes the wrong resource and an observer that fires too often would be debugged together for no reason. It also has a known trap worth writing down before it is built: `photoLibraryDidChange` fires on a background queue for every change to the library, including ones in albums we do not care about, and the batching the doorbell already demands (`PLAN.md`, *The doorbell, and the batching it still demands*) applies with more force here than it does to files.

**Pinned individual assets, `SourceKind.photosAsset`.** `PLAN.md` Phase 3 lists them and they are genuinely wanted. They are excluded here because they are a second provider with a second picker affordance, and because `SourceKind.file` — the exact analogue — already demonstrated that one source per item produces a wall of rows in a panel that has no sections yet. Adding the Photos version of a problem the file version already has, before the fix for it exists, is buying the same debt twice. When sections land, this is the natural next thing.

**The whole library as a source.** Tempting, and not in `PLAN.md`. `smartAlbumUserLibrary` ("Recents") is the closest thing PhotoKit offers, and it is not quite "everything" — it excludes hidden, and its relationship to shared library content varies. More to the point, a source meaning *all my photographs* has a different character from an album: it is unbounded, it changes constantly, and it makes the byte-budget question urgent in a way a curated album does not. It deserves to be asked for rather than to arrive as a side effect of listing smart albums.

**Multiple Photos libraries.** A stated non-goal in `PLAN.md`, not a deferral. PhotoKit talks to the system library and there is no public API to open another.

## Documents this touches, and where they disagree

**Acted on 2026-08-26, at Syd's instruction.** This section was written while both documents were untouched; all three were brought current together, and what follows records where each now stands.

- **`PLAN.md`, Phase 3.** Lists the Apple Photos provider, watching, and individually pinned assets together. This plan takes the provider, holds watching and pinned assets, and argues both above. If that split is right, Phase 3's bullet is what would record it.
- **`PLAN.md`, *Getting full-resolution originals out of Photos*.** Says the `.fullSizePhoto`-then-`.photo` rule "needs the Photos provider's spike to measure it against a real library." Phase 1 is that measurement, and its result belongs there when it exists.
- **`MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md`, *Sources in Settings*.** Said `Add from Photos Library…` is "present and disabled, because the provider does not exist yet." The menu item is gone: the affordance is now `Select Collections…` in the *Apple Photos* panel, still disabled, and the provider does exist.
- **`MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md`, *Sources by kind, in sections*.** Said "Photos and Google Photos get their own sections when those providers arrive." Photos got a panel rather than a section, for the reason in *The panel, and what it became instead* — there is one Photos library and never a list of them. Google Photos is untouched by that argument and would still be a section, or a panel of its own, whenever it arrives.
- **`PLAN.md`, *No deduplication in v1*.** Reversed. `SchemaV9` deduplicates strictly on identity, because a collection picker makes overlapping sources the normal case.
- **`Deck and Queue v2.md`, *Eviction*.** Updated: eviction now stops at one servable file rather than emptying the cache, which is *Always have something to show* applied to the ceiling.
- **`Documentation/photogoroundd.md`.** **Now behind rather than correctly ahead.** Three routes exist as of 2026-08-26 — `GET /v2/photos/albums`, `GET /v2/photos/authorization`, `POST /v2/photos/authorization` — and SERVICE describes none of them. The rule that kept it silent was that a man page describing something unbuilt is worse than one that is behind; that rule no longer applies. Not edited here, because man pages are Syd's.
