# Summary

Photos-Go-Round is a personal photo-shuffle system: a background agent maintains a SQLite "deck" of photos drawn from Apple Photos albums, arbitrary disk folders, and eventually Google Photos, caches them on disk at full resolution, and hands them to whatever wants to display them — desktop wallpaper, screensaver, widgets, and apps across Apple's platforms.

# Running it

## The agent

**Launching the app starts it.** Since 2026-09-21 every launch of `Photos-Go-Round.app`, in every build configuration, installs the agent as a per-user LaunchAgent if it is not there and restarts it; Help › Install Agent does the same. The plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` points at the agent inside the app bundle. `Release App Installer.md`, `Documentation/Installing.md`.

Without the app — each takes `--variant release|debug|claude`:

```
./Scripts/install.sh --variant debug --agent
pgr_install start --variant debug
pgr_install stop --variant debug
./Scripts/uninstall.sh --variant debug --agent
```

⌘R on the `Install Agent` scheme installs a development build's agent the same way.

In a terminal instead, where `^C` stops it and nothing is installed:

```
./Scripts/run-server.sh
```

Debug by default; `--release` or `--claude` for the others. It builds the `Photos-Go-Round Server` scheme first, so a stale binary is never run. **Each build has exactly one library, since 2026-09-24** — `~/Library/…/com.sydpolk.photosgoround[.debug|.claude]` — and nothing chooses another; the `.dev` library and `--prod` are gone. Syd: "They should be completely separate builds with completely separate assets."

**The port is chosen per build and per user, since 2026-09-21**: 20000, 23000 or 26000 for Release, Debug or Claude, plus a hash of the user name, and a kernel-assigned port if that one is taken. The agent publishes it as `servicePort` in the build's preference domain, beside the `serviceSecret` every request has to carry. `--port 9000` pins one; `--no-publish` publishes nothing. `Service Port Plan.md`, `Multi-user Support.md`.

The agent prints its dashboard's address when the listener is ready — `http://localhost:<port>/dashboard`. The app's About box and Settings show the link only with Option held. Sources are named once and written through to preferences:

```
./Scripts/run-server.sh --add-folder ~/Pictures/Wallpaper
./Scripts/run-server.sh --add-folder --recursive ~/Pictures/Trips
```

Inspecting and configuring, with or without the agent running:

```
pgr_ctl status
```

**Built and put on a `PATH` since 2026-09-19**, rather than run through `swift build`. It addresses one build configuration's library at a time, the one it was built as; `--release`, `--debug` or `--claude` picks another. `Documentation/pgr_ctl.md`.

## The screensaver

```
./Scripts/make-saver-bundle.sh --install
```

Builds the Xcode target, copies it to `~/Library/Screen Savers`, and kills `legacyScreenSaver` and `ScreenSaverEngine` — both cache the previous build for the life of the process, so without that a rebuild silently runs the old one.

Then select it, under Screen Saver → Other:

```
open "x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.ScreenSaver-Settings.extension"
```

**Nothing loads a saver that is not selected**, and an unselected one produces an empty log that looks exactly like a bundle that failed to load. If `legacyScreenSaver` appears nowhere in the log, no legacy saver was loaded at all and the bundle is not the problem.

`--spike` builds the Phase 1 sandbox probe instead, which links nothing and draws diagnostics.

## Testing the screensaver

The agent must be running; the saver is a client.

```
open -a /System/Library/CoreServices/ScreenSaverEngine.app
```

Runs the selected saver without waiting for the idle timer. Move the mouse to dismiss.

```
/usr/bin/log show --info --last 10m \
    --predicate 'subsystem == "com.sydpolk.photosgoround" AND category == "saver"'
```

`log` is a zsh builtin, hence the full path; `--info` is required or the per-photograph lines are filtered out.

What a healthy run looks like:

- `agent on port N via suite` or `via file` — `file` means the sandbox refused the preference domain and the fallback recovered.
- One `new loop for display <uuid>` per screen, and `joined the loop … now N views` for every extra view. A second `new loop` for the same screen is a bug.
- `showing card C deal D at WxH`, once per photograph, with every view of one display reporting the same card and deal.
- On dismissal, every `new loop` matched by a `loop stopped`. A `new loop` with neither a `loop stopped` nor a `gone` is a loop still asking with nothing on screen.

Counting an overnight run — **from the agent, not the saver**. The saver's per-photograph line is `.info`, which is memory-only and gone by morning; the agent's serve line is `.notice` and persists:

```
/usr/bin/log show --last 12h \
    --predicate 'subsystem == "com.sydpolk.photosgoround" AND category == "deck"' \
    | grep -c "consumer=screensaver"
```

A healthy night is a flat rate: a ten-second dwell is about 341 an hour, and roughly double that means two loops are running for one display.

## Xcode

Every product is a target in `Photos-Go-Round.xcodeproj` — app, tests, `Photos-Go-Round Saver`, `Photos-Go-Round Server`, `pgr_ctl`, `pgr_install`, `Photos-Go-Round Wallpaper` and its host — so anything can be run under the debugger.

**`xcodebuild` is the only build route since 2026-09-19.** Syd: "what I really want is each target runnable via xcodebuild." Not `swift build`, which has only `debug` and `release` and so cannot produce the `Claude` identity; the suites run by `xcodebuild test -scheme "Package Tests"`, which reaches all five package test targets. The `Photo-Go-Round Saver Spike` target was deleted the same day. `Plans/Xcode - Separate Build and Run.md`.

# Rationale

This is a decades-old itch, chased through a friend's "Desktop Picture" extension on classic Mac OS in 1992 and through Mac OS X's built-ins from 2001 onward. The tooling has been better and worse over the years, but not once in all that time has any of it handled the actual request: *take this giant blob of photos and do something nice with it.* Apple's screensaver still has only the display half solved — the transitions and layouts are genuinely beautiful — while its selection GUI chokes outright on folders holding large numbers of pictures, and what it does show is low-resolution cached thumbnails rather than originals pulled down from iCloud. Splitting the *library* problem (what to show, in what order, cached where) from the *display* problem (how to show it) is the seam where every previous attempt broke; getting it right means one deck feeds every surface, and adding a surface later — a tvOS top shelf, a Vision Pro picture frame — is a display-layer job rather than a rewrite.

# Phases

Each phase carries its own spike rather than front-loading them all, so the first running thing arrives as early as possible. Each new surface is also the first real test of assumptions made before it, so expect sandboxing and architecture decisions to move as the sequence proceeds — the design below is arranged to absorb that rather than to resist it.

**The Mac is finished to 1.0 before any other device is started.** Decided 2026-08-25. Every non-Mac phase below — the iOS and iPadOS app, the iOS widget, the Watch, tvOS and visionOS — is deferred past that line and keeps its number rather than being renumbered around. What stays in front of 1.0 is the Mac: the app, the Apple Photos provider, the screensaver, the wallpaper, the Mac widget, and watching for changes.

- **Phase 1 — complete.** Staged 2026-08-17 and left alone; the gate below is met. **The Mac server for pictures.** `PhotoGoRoundKit` — SQLite schema and migrator, the pool, the deck, the queue, the source protocol and its file-backed providers, the cache — plus the headless macOS process that owns it, **run from the command line**. Folder and explicitly-selected-file sources. No UI at all, and no packaging: registering as a login item is a much later concern, and nothing in Phase 1 should depend on it.
  - **Exit gate: the server is staged and running, and stays running.** Concretely:

    ```
    screen -h 10000
    cd photo-go-round
    ./Scripts/photogoroundd
    ```

    Sources are named at launch, by flag or by environment:

    ```
    PGR_FOLDERS=~/Pictures/A  PGR_FOLDERS_RECURSIVE=~/Pictures/Albums ./Scripts/photogoroundd
    ```

    Colon-separated the way `PATH` is, and adding the same folder twice is a no-op — so the variable describes what should be true rather than what to do, and is safe to leave set across restarts. **First run writes them to preferences**, so every later run needs no arguments at all.

    This is not a stopgap for the missing CLI. Naming initial sources at launch is how a service ought to be configurable, and it would still be right with `pgr_ctl` present.

    Then a long scrollback in a detached `screen`, left alone for a day, and still serving pictures when you come back to it. **Deliberately not launchd** — a login item is packaging, it arrives much later, and making Phase 1 depend on it would mean debugging TCC and code signing before the library is known to work. What this gate tests is that the thing survives being *used*: that it does not leak, wedge, spin, or quietly stop; that its output is readable a thousand lines later; and that a second terminal can add a source and see the agent notice.
  - **Result, 10h08m unattended.** Ten hours and eight minutes on a second machine, 7,955 photos from one recursive folder. The queue reached 1,001 six seconds after launch and still read 1,001 at the end — filled on the first pass and held, through roughly 121 scan cycles, with no console output in between. Resident size 92 MB at the final sample and 2.3% CPU.

    Both of those numbers needed a baseline to mean anything, which is the part worth keeping. An idle agent sits at **36 MB** and a scan peaks it at **96 MB**, returning afterwards — so 92 MB at the ten-hour mark is a sample that landed during a scan, not ten hours of growth. And the CPU reading is the one that rules out the failure this gate exists to catch: a wedged agent prints nothing *and* burns nothing, so silence alone proves neither. It was working.
  - A library that only ever runs under `swift test` has not been shown to work, it has been shown not to crash. Everything this project has found that the test suite missed — stdout buffering that only bites when stdout is not a terminal, an unavailability reason that said the wrong thing, a schema column deleted along with its neighbour — was found by standing it up.
- **Phase 1.5 — complete.** Closed 2026-08-18; the gate below is met. **The service is the interface.** An HTTP endpoint on the Mac that hands a client a picture rendered to the resolution it asked for. Clients stop opening the database and the cache; the service becomes the only thing that touches either.
  Built in milestones, each run before the next begins, so that the risky
  part is the only new thing at any moment.

  - **1.5.1 — the endpoint, returning originals. Done.** `GET /v1/next` carrying
    a resolution, which is accepted and ignored: `200` and the original bytes, or
    `204` when there is nothing queued. The endpoint pops the queue entry whether
    or not the download succeeds; there is no reservation and nothing to reclaim.
    One console line per request, with the consumer, the size asked for, the deal
    ordinal, the bytes, and the latency.
  - **1.5.2 — the renderer. Done.** `w` and `h` stopped being ignored:
    `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` off the main thread, `Accept` deciding
    HEIC or JPEG, and the client drawing what it is handed 1:1 without
    resampling. Nothing is enlarged, so a box bigger than the original returns
    the original's pixels. A photo that will not render is skipped to the next
    queue entry and retired after three attempts, which is migration 3 — a
    `render_failures` column, since removing the row would only mean the next
    rescan found the file again.
    **Changed 2026-09-16.** A resize now runs on one serial `Resizer` and a
    request waits at most a second for it; past that it gets the original,
    untouched, and the client scales and orients it. So a client no longer draws
    only what it is handed 1:1 — `Shuffle` decodes to its box with EXIF
    orientation applied. `Agent Performance Overhaul.md`, Phases 2 and 2a.
  - **1.5.3 — the rendering cache. Done.** The cache became `(photo, resolution)`,
    bounded by bytes alone; `cachePhotoCap` is gone. Its index lives in memory,
    rebuilt at startup by walking UUID-keyed filenames, so migration 4 both adds
    the identities and drops `cache_path` and `materialized_at`. `verifyResidency`
    and `sweepOrphans` went with them: an index built *from* the disk cannot
    disagree with it, and a file the database does not claim is deleted at the
    rebuild.

    **Measured, twenty alternating requests at 100×100 and 1000×1000 across
    three photographs:** six misses — exactly one render per photograph per size
    — then fourteen hits. After killing the agent and starting a fresh process,
    eight hits from eight, the index rebuilt from filenames with nothing in
    memory and nothing in the database recording what was held.

    **Reversed 2026-09-06. The cache no longer keeps renderings**, and the key
    is a photograph's UUID alone. Everything else in this item stands — the
    in-memory index rebuilt from filenames, `cachePhotoCap` gone, the byte
    ceiling as the only bound. See *The resize cache is removed* and, for what
    is left of the eviction rule, *Eviction*.

  - **1.5.4 — the floating port. Done.** The listener asks the kernel for a port
    rather than holding 9000, and publishes what it gets to preferences under
    `servicePort`, where every process on the machine can read it; `pgr_ctl
    status` prints it. Two agents can now run side by side without either being
    told about the other. `--port` still pins a number, which is what a `curl`
    you type by hand wants.

    The withdraw on the way out could not be a `defer`: **this process only ever
    ends by signal**, so the `defer` never ran and every ordinary stop left an
    address behind that `pgr_ctl status` then named. It is a `DispatchSourceSignal`
    on `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` — the agent's only graceful-shutdown machinery, and
    it exists solely to take the address down.

  Nothing on this phase's absent list is outstanding any more, and three things
  it used to carry are settled rather than deferred. **The listener binds loopback
  and stays there** — nothing off this Mac talks to its service, so there is
  nothing to widen. **Authorization is not needed** at that boundary: on loopback
  the only reachable caller is a process already running as this user, which is a
  different question from every device on the Wi-Fi and does not want the same
  answer. And **revocation moved past 0.1**, since there is nothing for
  `GET /v1/revocations?since=` to tell until a client is holding a picture up,
  and the serve-time check already covers hand-off.

  - **Exit gate: a client draws pictures over the wire without ever opening the container.** Two `curl` processes asking at once never receive the same photograph; the same photograph asked for twice at one size decodes once and is served from disk thereafter; and both survive the agent being restarted, since the index is rebuilt from the filenames. Met. *The gate previously said "from a second machine on the same Wi-Fi", which belonged to the cross-device design that every-platform-serves-itself replaced.*

- **Phase 2 — complete.** Closed 2026-08-18; the gate below is met. **`pgr_ctl`, an internal Swift command-line tool to exercise the server.** A **separate binary**, because the service has exactly one job and answering questions is not it. Add sources, refresh them, peek at the queue, inspect the cache, read and write preferences, run the shuffle-quality statistics. Serving pictures is `curl` against Phase 1.5's endpoint, so the rig covers what is *not* a service operation. This is how the server is proven correct before any window exists, and it stays the rig for everything scriptable afterwards. Never shipped.
  - **Built, and its gate is met**: a folder added, the pool filled, the queue filled behind it, a hundred pictures served, a photograph deleted mid-queue and never shown again, a drive unplugged with the cached ones still coming.
  - **Exit gate: `pgr_ctl` builds and drives a running server end to end.** Add a folder, watch the pool fill, watch the queue fill behind it, serve a hundred pictures, remove a photo and confirm it never appears again, unplug a drive and confirm the cached ones keep coming. Every one of those is a thing you do at a prompt against a live agent, and none of them is a unit test.
  - The two gates are the same principle applied twice, and it is worth naming: **a phase ends when you have used it, not when it compiles.** Everything found in this project so far that a test suite missed — stdout buffering under launchd, an unavailability reason that said the wrong thing, a schema column deleted along with its neighbour — was found by running the thing.
- **Phase 3** — **The Mac app that calls it.** Just a window showing the shuffle — sized to fit, with the pan — that can be taken full screen. No source management, no settings: `pgr_ctl` already does that. This is the milestone that proves the whole idea, and it is small. **As built, 2026-09-12**: the window and full screen, a Settings panel for sources and the wallpaper, and the About box's dashboard link; the pan waits with the saver's motion, and watching and the fit options are not built.
  - Full screen makes it the screensaver's rehearsal space. The fit, the pan, the transitions, and the empty state all get tuned here, in a window with a debugger attached, long before Phase 6 has to make them work inside someone else's sandbox.
  - **The Apple Photos provider lands here too — built** for albums, smart albums, and Favorites, at full resolution, so the window is showing a real library rather than a test folder; individually pinned assets are declared and have no provider yet. See `Apple Photos Plan.md`. Spike first: confirm `PHAssetResourceManager` returns true originals for iCloud-optimized assets, and measure throughput.
  - **Settle the App Group container before anything else in this phase.** An Xcode-launched sandboxed app does not use `~/Library/Containers`; CoreDevice redirects it. See *Where an Xcode-launched app puts its container*. **Moot as built**; see the question two bullets down.
  - **Watching lands here — not built as of 2026-09-12.** `FSEventStream` and `PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver`, so the pool stops depending on the scan interval to notice that a folder changed. **Telling a client to drop a picture it is already showing does not** — that is post-0.1. See *Revoking a photo that is already on screen* and *Deferred: retracting a photo already on screen*.
  - **All of the fit and aspect options land here — not built as of 2026-09-12; there is still one fit** — rather than being held back to *Beyond 0.1*. A window is the first place a person can see the difference between fitting, filling, and tiling, and the first place the choice can be made by eye instead of by argument. The service already takes a box and knows nothing about what fills it, so a `fit` parameter arrives alongside `w` and `h` without changing what either means.
  - **The App Group container question may have gone.** Phase 1.5 makes the app a client that is handed bytes, so it need not open the container at all. Confirm that before spending an afternoon on CoreDevice's redirection. **Confirmed: it went.** The app is unsandboxed, has no App Group, and opens no container.
  - **Two measurements moved here from Phase 2**, where they were parked as blocked and were never part of that gate. **Both are settled as of 2026-09-06, and neither by the means described here.**

    *Decode time to display size* was taken off the development cache rather than in a window: 2,932 real originals, rendered to an 1800px box and HEIC-encoded. **109 ms at the median, 181 ms at p90, 670 ms worst of a 41-file sample; the ten largest files (38 MB mean) came in at 295 ms median and 1063 ms worst.** That is an order of magnitude above the "tens of milliseconds" this plan asserted in three places, and it is the number the render-on-demand design is actually judged on. It is spent inside the gap between pictures rather than on a blank frame, because the client is serial and the previous picture stays up — so it is affordable, but it was never as cheap as written. What a window would still add is *feel* rather than a number.

    *The byte-budget sweep* across 5 / 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 GB is **cancelled rather than pending.** It presupposed the cache was a prediction about what would be wanted soon, where a bigger budget buys a better hit rate and the sweep finds the knee. The cache is a staging area for the queue, so the budget follows the queue instead: twice its working set, which needs no sweep to find. See *The resize cache is removed*.
  - **Web services for managing sources — built**: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE /v1/sources` on the agent, so a client can list, add, reconfigure, and remove without opening the database. See *The database is private to the service*.
  - **UI for managing them in the app — built**: a Settings panel showing what is configured with its counts and state, pickers to add, and buttons to remove and to reconfigure. See `MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md`.
  - Diagnostic panels accrete later, as the phases that need them arrive — not in Phase 3. **The one diagnostic surface that did arrive in Phase 3 is the agent's dashboard**, a page the agent serves rather than a panel in the app.
  - **The agent's dashboard — built 2026-09-12 and 2026-09-13; stood up on the laptop and on Plex on 2026-09-14, and working.** A page the agent serves at `/dashboard`, redrawn every second: the last picture served with its name and source, photos in the database with those added and removed by source since launch, photos in the cache, cache bytes against the ceiling, the queue against `queueSize`, pictures served since launch, cache lookups on the serve side and the fetch side, cache evictions, and agent errors grouped by kind — each gone a minute after it stops, unless it is a standing condition. Linked from the app's About box. See *The agent's dashboard*.
  - **The agent performance overhaul — 2026-09-16 to 2026-09-19, closed, in its own plan, `Agent Performance Overhaul.md`.** The app and the screensaver lost the agent three times in one afternoon; a thread sample showed every thread in the shared pool stuck resizing and waiting on the write lock. Built: the `TIMING:`, `LOCK:`, `STARTUP:`, `DEADLINE:`, `POOL:`, `MEMORY:` and `RENDER:` log lines, a one-second budget on serving's *is it still there?* check, one serial `Resizer` off the pool, a sized request that sends the original when its resize runs over budget, the resize cache returning, eviction after every write instead of on a timer and then on an `Evictor` actor with a connection of its own, the refresh locking only to write in pages of 100 read before the lock, a lane — an actor with a thread of its own — per request, refresh and downloads on actors of their own with **no `NSLock` left in the agent or the kit**, the cache index read from the database at launch, and `Deadline`'s timer moved off the cooperative pool. **And the LaunchAgent's `ProcessType` is `Adaptive` since 2026-09-17**: as `Background`, macOS throttled the agent's disk I/O, which was most of a restart's delay and all of serving's long write locks. **Boot to serving went from 3m52s–8m22s to about 70 s, and warm `listening` to 41 ms.** The last phase — giving the fetch lanes threads of their own — was **dropped on the evidence**: a probe measured the cooperative pool at `0ms typical` across 325 windows, so the starvation it would have fixed was not happening.
  - **The app's own features have their own plan**: `MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md`, starting with a Settings panel that adds and removes sources. That reverses *The Mac app as instrument panel*'s "it manages no sources", and the reversal is argued there rather than here.
- **Phase 4 — deferred past 1.0.** iOS and iPadOS app, carrying both roles in one process, since iOS has no place to put a separate server.
- **Phase 5 — deferred past 1.0.** iOS widget: now part of Photos-Go-Round Widgets.app, planned in `Photos-Go-Round Widgets.md`.
- **Phase 6 — v1 built, 2026-09-09.** `Screensaver Plan.md` Phases 1 to 4 are complete: the spike, the display code moved into `PhotoGoRoundDisplay`, photographs on screen, and the bouncing empty state. Mac screensaver: a `.saver` bundle, one photo at a time, sized to fit, panning slowly along whichever axis would otherwise be black. **v1 drops the pan and the cross-fade; decided 2026-09-07.** Photo display only, doing what the app window already does, as a proof of concept — the motion is deferred rather than dropped and returns as its own phase. Planned in `Screensaver Plan.md`.
  - Spike first: can a saver inside `legacyScreenSaver` make an HTTP request? That is the whole question now — it needs no file access to the container and no write access to the deck.
  - **Run 2026-09-07, and it was not the whole question.** It can make the request: `200` from both `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, from inside the host, on a stub that linked nothing. It cannot read the preference domain that says *where* to send it — `UserDefaults(suiteName:)` hands a sandboxed process a suite that opens cleanly and holds nothing, so the denial is indistinguishable from the agent having published no port at all. Reading the `.plist` directly works, and is the mechanism now.
  - **The gate as written had a trap in it.** `ScreenSaverEngine` runs whichever saver is *selected*, so a bundle that is installed but not chosen produces a perfectly empty log and looks exactly like one that failed to load.
- **Phase 7 — in the app, built 2026-09-10, first run 2026-09-11; its exit gate is under way.** Its own binary is `Wallpaper Plan.md` Phase 2, not built. Mac wallpaper: per-screen `NSWorkspace.setDesktopImageURL`, scheduled by the server. **Planned in `Wallpaper Plan.md`. Corrected 2026-09-10: not scheduled by the server.** The wallpaper is a client of the agent like every other surface — the Mac app runs it first, and a binary of its own later — because "the agent's job is just to serve pictures."
- **Phase 8** — Mac widget: now part of Photos-Go-Round Widgets.app, planned in `Photos-Go-Round Widgets.md` (2026-09-26). This document is updated when that work changes code in the rest of the system, not before.
- **Phase 9 — deferred past 1.0.** Apple Watch: a watchOS app plus its WidgetKit widget, fed photos by the paired iPhone.
  - Spike first: confirm a photo survives the watch's widget rendering modes legibly, and measure what `WCSession.transferFile` costs for a rolling set of small derivatives.
- **Phase 10 — deferred past 1.0.** Other platforms: tvOS top shelf, visionOS wall-mounted frame.
- **Phase 11** — Google Photos provider behind the same source protocol. Last because of its OAuth flow, not because of anything structural.

Distribution is a 1.0 concern, not an 0.1 one: 0.1 runs from Xcode and from a locally built binary. What 1.0 needs — packaging, agent registration, screensaver installation, and an update mechanism — is worked out under *Shipping it* below, where the conclusion is that `SMAppService` probably removes the need for an installer altogether.

Everything above is 0.1, and it ships with one fit, one layout, and one transition. Display richness — alternate fits, tiling, transition styles, per-surface timing, more widget families — is deliberately held back and collected under "Beyond 0.1" below, where what each item costs is sketched rather than gated.

Phases 1 and 2 run on file-backed sources alone — folders and individually selected photos — so the deck, the queue, and the cache are proven where there is no permission flow and no network to fail. Apple Photos then arrives with the Mac app, which is the point at which there is somewhere to look at it.

# Design Decisions

*Storage and the deck*

- **The only things outside our own code are Apple's OS frameworks and the photo libraries themselves.** No packages, no SDKs, no vendored source. Since PhotoKit is Apple's, the sole genuine external dependency in the entire project is the Google Photos web API — one optional provider, at the very end.
- **Raw SQLite and hand-written SQL. No ORM, no wrapper.** `libsqlite3` ships in the OS on every Apple platform, so there is nothing to bundle and nothing to vet. WAL mode is what makes the agent's own concurrent connections safe — one per in-flight request — which Core Data's SQLite store explicitly is not, and the deck is set-based SQL that an ORM would only obscure.
- **The database is disposable; only preferences are durable.** Everything in SQLite — the pool, the queue, cache bookkeeping — is derivable by rescanning and re-fetching. **The source list is the one thing that is not**, which is exactly why it lives in `UserDefaults` and the `source` table is a copy of it. Deleting it and the cache alongside is a legitimate recovery for any problem, and costs one rescan. Preferences live in `UserDefaults` precisely because they are the one thing that cannot be reconstructed. This is why schema changes before 1.0 need no migration, and why nothing in the design pays to protect data that can simply be rebuilt.
- **The database is private to the service; clients ask over HTTP.** No client opens it, so SQLite stays a choice that can be unmade. A client asks the agent for a picture *and* for facts about the library, and changes it the same way. Preferences keep the durable source list, the published `servicePort`, and every setting. `pgr_ctl` is the exception and stays one — it is the rig, not a client. See *The database is private to the service*.
- **A source's identity is `Source.uuid`, which the database already mints and the cache already uses to name its storage.** Preferences address a source by locator, because that is the thing the user actually chose; the UUID is what `GET /v1/sources` returns and what `DELETE /v1/sources/<uuid>` takes, so a client can name a source without opening the database.
- **Rows are cheap and complete; bytes are expensive and windowed.** The database holds an identifier row for *every* photo in every source, however many that is. The cache holds a bounded window of actual image files. Conflating the two would cap the shuffle at the cache size.
- **The deck is a circular queue of eligible cards, with a pass reshuffle as the floor beneath it.** A photo is eligible once more than *w* deals have gone by since it was dealt, which leaves `N − w − 1` candidates available at every deal and never runs dry; the pass rule catches only the two cases where the window has no answer — fraction 1.0, and a library whose dealable population is within `w + 1`. Both rules are one comparison against `max(pass_start_seq, deal_seq - w - 1)`, and the pass is one integer in a one-row table.
- **A photo may repeat across a pass boundary, and we accept it.** This is a photo shuffle, not a casino. Preventing it costs a guard band and a relaxation path, to spare someone who happens to be watching when two passes meet — every few weeks — from seeing a picture twice.
- **Selection takes a uniformly random offset into the eligible set, never its first row.** Ordering by a re-rolled random key and taking the minimum starves photos permanently: a high key loses, is never re-rolled *because* it lost, and loses forever. Measured at fraction 0.5, that gives showings from 3 to 391 where a random offset gives 186 to 217.
- **The window is a configurable fraction of the pool, default 0.5.** At 1.0 the window is unsatisfiable and the pass alone governs: the classic every-photo-once-before-any-repeat shuffle, reshuffled each time through. Lower values let photos recur sooner, which matters on a fifty-thousand-photo library where strict fairness means never seeing a favourite again. Exposed as a user default from day one, and worth a slider later.
- **One photograph is one row, whichever source found it. Reversed 2026-08-26; `SchemaV9`.** The content hash this decision was waiting for turned out not to be needed: a Photos asset in twelve collections has one `localIdentifier`, and a file under two overlapping folders has one absolute path. Both are already in hand at intake, so identity costs nothing to compute and a unique index enforces it. A hash would only buy genuinely distinct copies of identical bytes in unrelated folders — rare, and arguably not even wrong to show twice. See *One photograph, one row*.

*Consumers*

- **One deck, shared by every surface.** Wallpaper, screensaver, and widgets all deal from the same sequence, so the repeat window holds across every surface together — a photo just shown on one cannot immediately reappear on another. Dealing is therefore a cross-process atomic operation, and the cache must stay ahead of the *fastest* consumer, not the average one.
- **The Watch app is a companion and requires the paired iPhone.** Not an independent watchOS app, even though the platform permits one. With no Photos framework and no sources of its own, an unpaired watch has nothing to show — so the dependency is declared up front rather than degraded into at runtime.
- **One global queue of ready pictures, and consumers just take the head.** Producers fill it, clients drain it, and two displays get different pictures because serving *removes* the entry rather than because they were dealt disjoint sets in advance. There are no per-consumer reservations, no hand sizes, and nothing to reclaim from a display that goes away.
- **The queue's size is a target, not a ceiling.** Dealing tops it up to `queueSize`, and lowering the number evicts nothing from the queue: it simply stops being topped up until serving brings it under. Nothing is evicted when an entry arrives; serving shortens the queue, and so does a card dropped because its bytes never came. **Corrected 2026-09-12**: this said a card returning from a completed fetch was never refused, which was true while a fetched card left the queue and came back; since 2026-09-05 a card stays on the queue while it is fetched.
- **A new card is placed at random among the cards present, never at the head. Decided 2026-09-05, reversing v2's FIFO.** An integer `rank` shifted on insert, migration 10, rather than v1's float key that needed respacing. A card dealt from a newly added source is shown within a picture or two instead of after a whole traversal, which is the immediate feedback that adding something to the set worked; a shorter queue would have bought the same and was declined, because a deep queue is what keeps pictures coming when the sources are hostile. see *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*.
- **Dealing happens whether or not anybody asked.** The heartbeat tops up a queue short of its target and leaves a full one alone. **Changed 2026-08-25, reversing an earlier decision made on evidence it did not have**: dealing used to be paced to pictures served, on the reasoning that a heartbeat filling a merely short queue was churn. That was affordable while every fetch was a local file read and a queue one card short stayed short for seconds. A Photos fetch can take five minutes, so the old rule leaves an idle agent doing nothing with the time it has most of, then makes the first picture after idle wait on a cold fetch.
- **A deal follows a picture that reached somebody, not a request that arrived.** The filler is rung beside `markDelivered` — the endpoint with a 200 in hand — and nowhere else. Rung at selection instead, as it was until 2026-08-25, one request that walked past three unrenderable photographs bought four fresh cards, against this document's own rule that a skip buys nothing.
- **Always show something, even a repeat.** When a walk finds nothing it can serve, the deck deals from what is already cached and fills the queue rather than answering *no photos*. Decided 2026-08-26 while iCloud Drive was wedged: a blank wall is worse than a photograph seen recently, and the repeat window exists to stop repeats being ordinary rather than to guarantee an empty screen. **The pool this falls back on shrank by an order of magnitude on 2026-09-06**, when the ceiling went from 10 GB to 1 GB — a few hundred photographs rather than thousands — so an offline session repeats far sooner than it used to. Accepted; see *The resize cache is removed*. **That fallback is no longer in the code**: when nothing is eligible the deal returns nothing, and the agent deals again when a request comes up empty. What an offline session shows is each unavailable source's held photographs, since 2026-09-07.
- **Blocking provider I/O never runs on the cooperative pool.** `BlockingWork` gives it threads of its own. A thread parked in a synchronous system call is one the runtime cannot use, and enough of them stop the process without any lock being held — twice now: four concurrent folder walks in August, then eleven `copyItem` calls against undownloaded iCloud Drive files.
- **Revised 2026-09-05: sixty seconds for every kind.** The fifteen-minute Photos deadline was set on a day everything touching iCloud on the machine was wedged, which was not known until later; the measurement described the machine, not the provider. **Every materialize runs against a deadline, and the lane comes back whether or not the work does.** Sixty seconds for every kind. The abandoned work is neither cancelled nor awaited — a blocked read answers neither — so what the deadline buys is the queue's own bookkeeping, not the provider's cooperation.
- **A photograph is not fetched twice at once, and the dedup lasts as long as the work.** Releasing it with the lane let a timed-out copy still be writing when its card came round again; the two collided on one staging path.
- **A source that keeps timing out is benched.** Four in a row, a minute, doubling each time it happens again, capped at an hour so a share that comes back is still noticed. Any success clears both the count and the backoff. Without it one bad source holds every fetch slot and the healthy ones are never asked.

*Sources*

- **Any number of sources, of mixed kinds, active simultaneously — from Phase 1.** A source is a row, not a mode. The deck is the union of every enabled source, so nothing in the schema or the deck logic ever assumes there is one.
- **Explicitly selected individual photos are a first-class source kind, not a folder special case.** Pinning one photo and adding a folder of ten thousand are the same operation to the deck.
- **Photos inside a folder source are stored folder-relative.** Only the source's own path is absolute, so moving or renaming a folder is one row to repair rather than fifty thousand — and we only ever write metadata to items the user explicitly handed us, never to the photos inside them.
- **A photo is checked against its source in the moment before it is shown.** A user who deletes a picture must never see it again — not once more, not in the minutes before a refresh notices. A residency check is not enough, because a materialized photo is *our* copy and deleting the original does not touch it. Providers therefore answer *present*, *absent*, or *unknown*, and the third is what stops an unplugged drive being mistaken for a deletion. **Since 2026-09-07 the Photos provider asks whether the album resolves before it asks about the photograph**, and an album that is not there answers *unknown*: a library rebuild that renumbered two albums had been answering *absent* for every cached photograph in them and deleting each as its turn came. See `Missing Albums Plan.md`.
- **Removed means removed.** A photo gone from a source that is demonstrably present is deleted from the pool, its queue entries cascade away, and our cached copy is deleted with it. No soft-delete tier, no `available` flag to reason about. These are transient images and per-photo history is not worth a second lifecycle; a file that returns is a new entry.
- **Changes are found by rescanning on an interval for 0.1; watching becomes a 1.0 requirement.** Rescanning is cheap and invisible — measured at 2.4 seconds for twenty thousand photos, with a concurrent consumer's deal latency unchanged at 0.1 ms median. But the play-time check only protects surfaces that render on demand. Widgets and the Watch render ahead of time and cannot be retracted, so before Phase 5 and Phase 9 a deletion has to *arrive*: `FSEventStream` for folders, `PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver` for Photos. The preferences plist stays polled either way.
- **The first refresh pass walks local sources first; every pass after it keeps the order they were added in.** Walking a local folder is milliseconds and a network share is minutes, so the one source that can put a picture on screen immediately should not be last behind ten that cannot — which is exactly where it sat, by id, on the first library this was run against. iCloud counts as remote, since `~/Library/Mobile Documents` looks local and may hold evicted placeholders. Only the first pass, because after it the queue is full and there is nothing left to be first for. The launch bridge it was written to serve is gone; it still puts the photographs that need no fetch into the pool first.
- **We survive folder renames and moves; anything else the user does inside a folder is theirs.** A photo reorganized within or between folders is treated as a departure and an arrival, losing its shuffle history. Recognizing it would require stamping every file, which is the cost the narrow scope exists to avoid.
- **Still images only. Videos are out of scope until 2.0.** Scanners filter them out deliberately rather than by omission, and the schema carries a `media_type` column from the first migration — so adding video later is a change to a predicate and a set of display capabilities, not a rescan of every source.
- **Animated GIF and animated HEIC display as their first frame, and always will.** Unlike video, this is a settled non-goal rather than a deferral. It also happens to be free: the subsampled decode already asks for frame 0.
- **Apple Photos is entirely optional; the system is complete without it.** A user who never wants the Photos library involved gets a fully working product from folders and individually selected files alone — and is never shown a Photos permission prompt, because we only ask when a Photos source is actually added.
- **Only the System Photo Library is reachable.** PhotoKit talks to whichever library Photos designates as the system one; there is no public way to open another. If the user switches system libraries, our stored asset identifiers stop resolving *en masse*, which is treated as the source becoming unavailable rather than as the photos being deleted. The same holds for one album that stops resolving while the library stays readable — a rebuild renumbers albums — and since 2026-09-07 it holds at the photograph as well as at the source. Listing such an album in the panel by name, with Remove and Reconnect, is `Missing Albums Plan.md`, Phases 3 to 5.
- **A Photos photograph's original filename is recorded when its original is fetched. Decided 2026-09-12; migration 12.** The provider already holds the asset's resources at that moment, so the name costs nothing there and a PhotoKit round trip anywhere else. Log lines, the dashboard, and `X-PGR-Name` all read it. See *The agent's dashboard*.
- **File-backed sources come first, Apple Photos after the Mac app, Google Photos last.** Prove the deck, cache, and display pipeline against plain files where there is no permission flow and no network to fail before adding the provider that has both.

*Cache*

- **The deck deals from every available photograph, and the queue fetches its own cards. Decided 2026-09-05, reversing v2's population.** One uniform draw over every row whose source is enabled and which has not been retired, whether or not its bytes are here and whether or not its source is reachable — a held photograph is served out of the cache regardless; a card goes on the queue regardless, the queue fetches the bytes of every card it holds and nothing beyond them, and serving *waits* for the head's fetch — a fetch that fails drops the card, and so does a wait that runs out; serving takes the new head, and drops that too if its bytes are not here. No credit counter: at a queue of twenty the depth bounds fetching on its own. See *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*. **Amended 2026-09-07: a source the scan has marked unavailable deals only what is held.** Its unheld photographs cannot be fetched, and once a failed fetch stopped deleting them they cost a card per pass for nothing; they wait outside the pool, rows and history untouched, until the source is back. A healthy source is still dealt in full, bytes or not. See `Missing Albums Plan.md`, Phase 2.
- **Reference in place on the internal volume; materialize from anywhere that can disappear.** A file on the boot volume is always there, so copying it is pure waste. A file on an external, removable, network, or iCloud Drive volume can vanish without notice, so it is copied into the cache. Whether a photo is referenced or materialized is a property of *where it lives*, not of which kind of source found it. **Since 2026-09-06 a referenced photograph occupies no cache bytes at all** — it used to hold renderings, which were the only thing the cache ever held for one.
- **Dealing writes a card and fetches nothing; the queue's fetcher fetches every card the queue holds, head first. Revised 2026-09-05 and 2026-09-07.** Four fetches at once across the whole queue — `downloadConcurrency` is one global number. Serving waits up to `serveWaitSeconds`, two seconds, for the head card's bytes, and drops every cold card after that wait. **Serving is what notices the queue has run short**, and therefore what deals; a round already in progress absorbs the next request rather than stacking with it, and the heartbeat also tops up any queue short of `queueSize`. See *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*. This bullet described a look-ahead window, a queue of pictures to cache, and a skip that never waited until 2026-09-05; all three are gone.
- ~~**At launch, three immediately-servable cards go in first, then the ordinary shuffle.**~~ **Gone with the servable-only pool; kept below for its reasoning.** A cold start is answered now by the heartbeat seeding the queue before the first refresh, dealing that needs no bytes, and the fetcher being kicked at once; see *Cold start*. A cold start otherwise deals a full queue whose every card is still being fetched and answers *no photos* to all twenty of them. A `referenced` file needs no fetch and a warm restart still holds whatever was cached, so a handful of those bridges the gap until the shuffled cards' bytes land; three rather than a queueful, because twenty from the one local folder is twenty consecutive pictures from one source. **It changes latency and nothing else** — shuffle keys, eligibility, the repeat window, and each source's share are all untouched. The bridge stops the moment the queue is full. Pairs with the first-pass source ordering under *Sources*.
- **Every photo is dealt; whether it is *shown* turns on its bytes being local when its turn comes.** An unmounted drive stops referenced photos being shown immediately; a vanished Photos library does not, since those were materialized into our cache. Orphans then shuffle out gradually as eviction reclaims whatever has gone longest unwanted — the cache's ordinary behavior is the garbage collector. **Since 2026-09-07 an unavailable source's unheld photographs are not dealt at all** — see the amendment two bullets up — so an unmounted drive's referenced photographs leave the pool rather than being dealt and dropped.
- **The cache is clearable on demand, and guarded against a full disk.** `pgr_ctl cache clear`, optionally per source or restricted to unavailable ones, never touching deck history. Separately, free space is checked before every fetch, because a byte ceiling bounds our copy and not the volume.
- **Unavailable sources are shown as unavailable, in orange, with the reason.** A source that has silently stopped contributing to the shuffle is indistinguishable from a bug.
- **The cache holds originals and nothing else, bounded by bytes. Revised 2026-09-06, reversing 1.5.3.** It held a rendering per `(photo, display box)` alongside each original, on the reasoning that a small library re-reads a rendering every few minutes. The box is the client's window in pixels and therefore drifts: a window moved two pixels made a second full set beside the first, and the development cache was holding 0.99 GB of near-duplicates against a hit rate near zero. Every sized request renders fresh now and the bytes are discarded, so **serving can never grow the cache**. *Reversed 2026-09-16, and built the same day:* resized copies are kept again, one per photograph, box asked for and format, with a row each; they share `cacheByteCeiling` with originals, and eviction takes the oldest file first by when it was made. `Agent Performance Overhaul.md`, Phase 2b. A photo count was always a poor proxy for the disk this protects — a thousand photographs is 2 GB or 100 GB depending on the camera — so bytes remain the only bound. See *The resize cache is removed*.

*Display*

- **One display mode in v1: shrink or expand, preserving aspect ratio.** Aspect fit, applied identically by the wallpaper and the screensaver — `scaleProportionallyUpOrDown` with clipping off. It is a setting from the start with exactly one value, so adding fill, center, and tile later is a new case rather than a new concept. **One difference, decided 2026-09-10: the space around the photograph.** The screensaver paints it black; the wallpaper leaves it in the fill colour set in System Settings — "use the System Settings fill color for now." See `Wallpaper Plan.md`, *The fit*.
- **Every surface has a defined empty state.** The screensaver bounces "No Photos Available" around the screen; the wallpaper leaves the existing desktop alone; the widget shows a static label. Nothing anywhere renders a blank screen that could be mistaken for a crash. **Changed 2026-09-26:** when the agent says *why* it has nothing — no sources, or nothing to show and nothing coming — the window and the screensaver say so at once, and the wallpaper shows the same words as a still picture. A bare empty answer, or no agent, still leaves the desktop alone. See *The empty state*.

*Sequencing*

- **Server, then a CLI to exercise it, then the Mac app that calls it, then iOS.** The headless library process is the foundation every surface sits on; the command line proves it correct before any UI exists, and a window showing the shuffle is the shortest proof the idea works. The kit's API is still shaped by iOS's constraints even though iOS arrives third, since retrofitting those is the expensive mistake.
- **`pgr_ctl` and the Mac app are permanent test harnesses, not scaffolding.** The command line covers anything scriptable, statistical, or concurrent; the app covers anything visual or timing-dependent. Every later surface is exercised through one of them before it gets its own home.
- **The Mac app is a window that can go full screen, plus a Settings panel for sources and the wallpaper, and an About box linking the agent's dashboard.** A full-screen window is visually what the screensaver will be, so the display behavior gets designed there and Phase 6 is left with only the sandbox to solve. Sources arrive because `pgr_ctl` never ships, which makes it the only user-facing way to add a photograph at all; everything else still belongs to `pgr_ctl`. See `MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md`.
- **Image widgets on the Mac, not only on iOS.** Syd, 2026-09-15: "I want to support image widgets on the Mac as well." Same WidgetKit code as iOS, and a widget is another HTTP client like every other surface. See *Widgets on macOS, and where the store actually lives*.
- **"Calls it" means an HTTP request.** The app is a client like every other surface and gets a picture rendered to the size of its window, which buys it out of the App Group container question entirely. The cost is that the service has to be running, which a login item and launchd activation cover.

*Platform and distribution*

- **Mac ships Developer ID direct, the iOS family ships App Store.** Your call, and it is the right one — a sandboxed app cannot install a `.saver` bundle, so App Store distribution and a screensaver are mutually exclusive. **Re-examined and confirmed 2026-09-25**: the mechanism exists, and App Store Review Guideline 2.4.5(ii) forbids it. See *The sandbox contingency*, *Whether the App Store is reachable*.
- **Two Mac products, eventually: a sandboxed App Store version that does what it can, and a Pro version sold direct with the full integration.** Syd, 2026-09-15. **Nothing is built for it yet, and until it is, the Mac is unconstrained** — Syd: "for now, we have full reign over the mac to do whatever we like." See *Two Mac products, sandboxed and Pro*.
- **A LaunchAgent, not a LaunchDaemon.** Photos access is per-user TCC and requires a user session; a system daemon cannot reach the library at all.
- **Installs are fully independent — no cross-device sync at all, with one forced exception.** iCloud Photos already puts the same photos on every device, so each install shuffles the same pool on its own; this buys out of `PHCloudIdentifier` mapping, a CloudKit layer, and deal-time conflict resolution entirely. The Apple Watch is the exception, because watchOS has no Photos framework and no sources of its own — the paired iPhone feeds it, one-directionally.
- **Clients ask the service over HTTP; preferences are the durable store and the control channel, never a client transport.** A surface requests a picture at the resolution it is about to draw at and is handed the pixels — it opens neither the database nor the cache. Multiple simultaneous clients, several of them on other devices, are what force it, since XPC cannot leave the machine. Darwin notifications keep exactly one job and one direction: locally, from the outside world to the service, where `defaults write` reconfigures a running agent and both ends share the preferences domain, so "go look" is still sufficient. Nothing rings the other way: a client wanting an answer asks for one. **One leftover in the code**: the agent still posts `cacheChanged` when a fetch lands or eviction frees space, and nothing observes it. See *The service is the interface* and *The database is private to the service*.
- **Minimum deployment target 27.0 on every platform, macOS included. The 26.0 hold on macOS was lifted 2026-09-14.** Syd: "you can go ahead and upgrade everything to our minimum support to macOS 27, so yes, use the OS 27 APIs." The target is 27: no back-deployment guards, no availability checks, no legacy code paths. *Until then this read "temporarily held at 26.0 on macOS until 27 ships", so the agent could run on a second Mac on the public release; see* The 27.0 baseline, and the temporary 26.0 hold.

*Engineering*

- **The kit owns policy; the hosts own scheduling.** `PhotosGoRoundKit` contains no timers, no run loop, and no opinion about when it is called — the Mac agent drives it from a continuous loop, the iOS widget drives it from a timeline provider. The two backends differ enormously and the boundary is drawn so that difference lives entirely on the host side.
- **The agent serves its own dashboard, and the app only links to it. Decided 2026-09-12.** An installed LaunchAgent's console goes nowhere and its unified log wants `log show`, so the facts that matter are one URL away instead. The About box shows the URL, port and all, and opens it in the default browser rather than a web view. See *The agent's dashboard*.
- **The dashboard's link is shown only when About or Settings is chosen with Option held. Decided 2026-09-24.** Syd: "This is a support option, anyway. I may not make the link public until you do some hidden action." See *The agent's dashboard*.
- **The dashboard is not served over HTTPS. Decided 2026-09-24.** Asked for on 2026-09-14 as a TODO; Syd, once it was weighed: "I just want the security warning to go away. I don't want to deal with auth on other machines", then "not worth it. we aren't doing this. ... it's ok for this to do the secure check when I am supporting a user." The listener is loopback only, so TLS would protect nothing on the wire; the only gain was the browser's *Not Secure* label. What that would have cost: a certificate for `localhost` made per Mac, trusted in the login keychain behind a password prompt on every Mac (Firefox would still warn, keeping its own trust store), and a second, TLS-only listener for the dashboard's routes so the saver, the wallpaper extension, `PictureClient`, `pgr_ctl` and `AgentProbe` were not broken by it until the certificate was trusted.
- **The agent records its errors by kind, not by text. Decided 2026-09-12.** Almost every error line carries a detail that changes each time — a photograph, a queue depth, a latency — so identical text never repeats; a fixed kind collapses the same trouble into one row with a count. Recorded in the agent only. See *The error record*.
- **Structured logging through `OSLog`, and logs go nowhere.** No crash reporter, analytics, or telemetry — never popular enough to justify it, and addable later if that changes. Unified logging is also the only mechanism that works from inside the screensaver's and widget's sandboxes, where a hand-rolled file logger could not write at all. **True of the file system as well since 2026-09-19**: no binary writes a log file, the LaunchAgent no longer captures the agent's stdout, and a release build logs per-request traffic a rung below the level that persists. Planned in `Logging.md`.
- **Swift 6 strict concurrency, shared core as a Swift package.** Every target — agent, app, saver, widget — links the same package.
- **The name is "Photos-Go-Round", hyphenated; the bundle identifier is `com.sydpolk.photosgoround`.** *Renamed 2026-09-22 from "Photo-Go-Round" and `com.sydpolk.photogoround`.* The hyphens are user-facing only — the display name and the bundles' names. Every bundle hangs off that identifier, the Swift modules are `PhotosGoRoundKit` and its siblings, and each build's preference domain derives from it.
- **The database holds state; `UserDefaults` holds preferences — with two named exceptions.** Sources, pool, queue, and cache are state. Fits, timings, transitions, and caps are preferences, living in the build's preference domain, `com.sydpolk.photosgoround[.debug|.claude]`, so they are settable from the command line. *The `.dev` domains went 2026-09-24, with one library per build.* The exceptions are `servicePort` and, since 2026-09-23, `serviceSecret`, which the agent publishes because a client needs them to find the service and to be let in, and there is no other way to be told. Everything else the agent derives is answered over HTTP rather than written down.
- **Settings are the only data a user would miss, and they are not exported. Decided 2026-09-27.** Syd, 2026-09-19: "the only thing in my data that would be actually missed by users if it disappeared is the settings"; and 2026-09-27: "we are not doing any export of settings. they are userxmachine specific." Everything else is derived — the database re-enumerates from the sources, the cache refetches, the deck's shuffle position is not precious — which was proven on 2026-09-19, when the whole library, the cache and both containers were deleted and rebuilt from four sources in minutes. So an upgrade, and the testing of one, may treat the container and the cache as disposable: throwing storage away costs time, not data, as long as the preference domains survive. They are the build's own domain, `com.sydpolk.photosgoround[.debug|.claude]`, and the surfaces' beside it, `….wallpaper` and `….screensaver`; `Storage` in `HostEnvironment.swift`, `WallpaperPreferences` and `ScreensaverPreferences`.
- **A test agent publishes nothing, so nothing follows it.** `servicePort` is written by whichever agent of that build started most recently, and `--container` isolates storage but not the preference domain — so a scratch run captures the app's window mid-session and serves it from a different library. `--no-publish` removes the confusion at its source rather than teaching clients a port to ignore, and needs no client change at all. What it costs is discovery: an unannounced agent is reachable only by the port it printed, which is the right way round for one somebody started on purpose.
- **Raw `defaults write` is noticed, and no preference ever needs the agent restarted.** Cross-process `UserDefaults` observation is unreliable, so the agent re-reads its preferences every thirty seconds, and at once when the `preferencesChanged` doorbell rings; every value is read where it is used, so nothing has to be applied.
- **Builds have no warnings, and no C++ is ever written. Decided 2026-09-15.** Syd: "I am a big believer in builds with no warnings", and "We will never voluntarily use C++." libc++ hardening is off in the Xcode project: `CLANG_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARY_HARDENING = ""`. See *Builds with no warnings: no C++, and schemes rather than targets*.
- **Xcode targets are built by scheme, never with `-target`. Decided 2026-09-15.** A `-target` build gives the local package targets a warning that a scheme build does not, and `Scripts/make-saver-bundle.sh` builds by scheme. Same section.

# Background

When this plan was begun, in August 2026, the repository was empty apart from a BSD 3-Clause license and an Xcode `.gitignore`. Toolchain on this machine is macOS 27.0, Xcode 27.0, Swift 6.4. This machine runs a 27 seed; 27 has not shipped publicly yet. Minimum deployment target is 27.0 across macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and visionOS, held at 26.0 on macOS until it does, so the server can run in the meantime on a second Mac on the current public release. *The macOS hold was lifted 2026-09-14, at Syd's direction; see* The 27.0 baseline, and the temporary 26.0 hold. No prior implementation existed, so nothing was constrained by an existing codebase — only by platform rules.

This problem has been pursued for a very long time: a friend's "Desktop Picture" extension on classic Mac OS in 1992, then Mac OS X's built-in wallpaper and screensaver from 2001, from inside Apple. Across three decades and many releases the quality has moved up and down without the core failure ever being fixed — nothing has been able to take a large, unstructured collection of photos and simply do the right thing with it. Every design decision below should be read against that: the thing being built is the part that has been missing the whole time.

The current workaround Syd lives with, and what it demonstrates: selecting a Photos album in Apple's screensaver is unusable past a couple of dozen photos, so he exports to a bespoke folder on disk instead — which the selection UI can barely ingest even once. Adding files to that folder afterwards works fine. *Re-opening the folder selection* does not: the screensaver goes belly up, and recovery means pointing it at a new folder holding only a few photos, letting it settle, then moving thousands of photos in behind it. Once running, the display itself is flawless. The wallpaper picker fails the same way, and additionally reverts to the stock Golden Gate image at random for a while before deciding to work again.

Three things follow. The broken component is selection, not rendering. Enumeration evidently happens once at selection time and is cached, which is why adding files works and re-selecting does not. And wallpaper cannot be treated as something you set — it has to be something you reassert.

Syd built a screensaver from Xcode's built-in template about two years ago. That template emits Objective-C; he has not written Objective-C in nine years and does not intend to. Nothing in this plan requires it — see below.

# Detailed discussions

## The 27.0 baseline, and the temporary 26.0 hold

Targeting 27.0 everywhere removes a whole category of work. `SMAppService`, Swift 6 strict concurrency, `ScreenCaptureKit`-era display APIs, and the modern WidgetKit and SwiftUI surfaces are all simply present; there are no `@available` ladders and no fallback implementations to write or test. Since this is software for you rather than for a market, there is no user base stranded on an older OS to weigh against that.

**Lifted 2026-09-14.** Syd: "you can go ahead and upgrade everything to our minimum support to macOS 27, so yes, use the OS 27 APIs", and "you can update the plan files with this decision." Every macOS minimum is now 27.0: `Package.swift`'s macOS line; `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` on the twelve Xcode target configurations that set 26.0; and `LSMinimumSystemVersion` in the agent's, the saver's and the saver spike's `Info.plist`, and in the one `Scripts/make-agent-bundle.sh` writes. *The saver spike target and that script were both deleted on 2026-09-19; the agent's and the saver's `Info.plist` carry it still.* There were no availability checks to remove — lifting it was the settings change the paragraphs below said it would be. The second Mac has to run 27 to run the agent from now on. The first 27-only API adopted is `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer.sampleBufferReceiver(adding:)`, in the wallpaper extension probe; see `Wallpaper Plan.md`. **What follows is as it was written while the hold stood.**

**The target is held at 26.0 until 27 ships, and the hold expires by itself.** This machine is on a 27 seed; the second Mac — the one that has to keep the agent running while nobody is at a desk — is on the current public release, because that is the only release there is. Building against a seed would mean the server could only run on the machine it was written on, which is precisely the wrong property for a background service. 27 will have shipped well before the server is finished, at which point the target goes to 27 and stays there.

Because the hold is temporary and self-expiring, the important thing is that **nothing may be designed around it.** No availability check, no fallback path, no "the 26 way of doing this" — if a 27-only API is ever the right answer, lift the hold early rather than write a guard that then has to be hunted down and deleted. Lifting it is a settings change rather than a code change, precisely because there is nothing to unwind: `Package.swift`'s macOS line, and `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` on the twelve Xcode target configurations that set 26.0. **The hold is macOS only** — `Package.swift` already names iOS 27.0.

So far the hold costs nothing at all: the kit builds and its whole test suite passes against 26 without a single availability check, because everything this project actually uses is far older than either release — `libsqlite3`, `OSLog` and `OSSignposter`, `Duration`, `SMAppService` (13), `NSWorkspace.setDesktopImageURL`, `PHAssetResourceManager`. The phases where a 27-only API might first have been tempting were the Photos provider in Phase 3 and the saver in Phase 6; **both were built under the hold, and neither wanted one.** WidgetKit arrives with Phase 8, and nothing imports it yet.

There is a second reason the hold is comfortable rather than merely tolerable. Phases 1 and 2 are a library and a command-line tool: no windows, no sandboxes, no OS integration points beyond SQLite and the filesystem. That is the part of the project least likely to want anything new from the OS, which is a good match for the only period during which the constraint applies.

One honest caveat: my knowledge runs to roughly mid-2026, and 27.0 shipped after that. Where this plan asserts platform behavior, those assertions describe the 26-and-earlier world. Any of them could have changed. That is why each phase carries its own spike, and I will verify against the installed SDK and current documentation rather than against memory before any of the later surfaces are designed in detail.

## Builds with no warnings: no C++, and schemes rather than targets

Syd, 2026-09-15: "I am a big believer in builds with no warnings." Two decisions came out of clearing the last of them.

**No C++, and libc++ hardening off. Decided 2026-09-15.** Syd: "turn off the C++ hardening. We will never voluntarily use C++."

- Xcode 27 passes `-D_LIBCPP_HARDENING_MODE=…` to every compile by default. `CLANG_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARY_HARDENING` resolves to `debug` for an unoptimised build and to `fast` otherwise, and Swift receives it too, behind `-Xcc`, for the clang importer. The project has no C++, so it hardens nothing.
- The project-level Debug and Release configurations set `CLANG_CXX_STANDARD_LIBRARY_HARDENING = ""`. **Empty, not `none`:** Xcode's spec maps `none` to `-D_LIBCPP_HARDENING_MODE=_LIBCPP_HARDENING_MODE_NONE`, which is still a define, and maps the empty value to no argument at all.
- **It does not reach the local package's targets.** Xcode builds `PhotoGoRoundAgentAPI`, `PhotoGoRoundDisplay`, `Console` and `PhotoGoRoundKit` in a package project of its own, and `Package.swift` has no way to set an Xcode build setting, so those four still receive the define. Without C++ it does nothing, and built by scheme they give no warning — below.
- Overriding the setting on the `xcodebuild` command line did reach the package targets, and then failed the build with "Unexpected input file: …/Photo-Go-Round.xcodeproj/6", for a reason not found. Not pursued.

**Xcode targets are built by scheme, never with `-target`. Decided 2026-09-15.** Syd: "yes, switch it to a scheme build."

- **The warning belonged to the build mode.** With every minimum at 27, `xcodebuild -target` builds of the app project gave each local package target "Conditional compilation flags do not have values in Swift; they are either present or absent (rather than '_LIBCPP_HARDENING_MODE=_LIBCPP_HARDENING_MODE_DEBUG')".
- **Measured on scratch copies of the working tree**, after Syd suggested trying it out with throwaway projects:
  - the package built alone with `xcodebuild -scheme`: no warning;
  - a minimal package with a library and an executable: no warning;
  - the app project built with `-target Photo-Go-Round`: the warning, reproduced;
  - the same project built by scheme, for `Photo-Go-Round`, `Photo-Go-Round Saver`, `Photo-Go-Round Saver Spike`, `Photo-Go-Round Server` and `pgr_ctl`: no warnings of any kind.

  The define was passed in every case that compiled a package target; only `-target` builds complained about it.
- `xcodebuild` makes a scheme for every target and package product on its own, so none has to be shared, and a scheme build takes `-derivedDataPath`.
- `Scripts/make-saver-bundle.sh` builds by scheme, and finds the bundle under `<output>/Build/Products/<configuration>/`. The Xcode app has always built by scheme.

**Where it stands, 2026-09-15:** a clean build of the Swift package with its tests, and scheme builds of every Xcode target, have no warnings, and all 856 tests pass. Cleared on the way:

- `PHAssetResource.originalFilename`, deprecated in macOS 27, replaced by `filename` in `SystemPhotoLibrary` and `pgr_ctl`'s Photos spike. `filename` may be nil, and becomes the empty string the provider already reads as "no name". Whether it returns the same string as before for an edited photograph is not measured.
- The wallpaper probe's deprecated `enqueue`, replaced by a render synchronizer's receiver; see `Wallpaper Plan.md`.
- 47 unnecessary `await`s and four unused values in the tests.
- The screensaver's `deinit` reading a main-actor logger; the logger is `nonisolated` now.

## Why SQLite rather than Core Data

You asked whether SQLite is "already embedded in the phone." It is. `libsqlite3.tbd` is part of the SDK on macOS, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS, and has been for the entire lifetime of those platforms. There is no binary to vendor and no size cost. The 2014-era hesitation no longer applies.

The stronger argument is multi-process access. On the Mac this system has at least three processes touching the library at once: the agent writing deck state, the screensaver reading the next N photos, and the config app editing sources. Core Data's SQLite store is documented as unsafe for concurrent access from multiple processes — there is no cross-process coordination of its row cache or its change notifications, and the failure mode is silent corruption rather than an error. SQLite in WAL mode is explicitly designed for this: multiple readers concurrent with one writer, coordinated by the OS.

**That was the argument when the choice was made, and the processes it names have since changed.** Since *The database is private to the service*, only the agent and `pgr_ctl` open the file — the screensaver and the app ask over HTTP — and WAL stays for the agent's own concurrent connections, one per request. See *WAL stays, for a different reason than it arrived*.

The third argument is that the deck *is* a query — a filter on the repeat window, ordered by a random key. Expressing that through `NSFetchRequest` gains nothing and costs the ability to write the one transaction that advances the deck atomically.

## No third-party dependencies, and what that means we write

The project takes no external packages. Everything is the system SDK plus code in this repository, and the only dependencies that reach outside that are the photo libraries themselves.

Worth stating precisely, because the boundary is unusually clean: PhotoKit is an Apple framework, so the Apple Photos provider is not an external dependency in any meaningful sense — it is OS surface, like AppKit or SQLite. That leaves the **Google Photos web API as the single genuine external dependency in the whole project**, and it is one optional provider arriving in the final phase. Everything before it depends on nothing but the operating system.

Two consequences follow from that being true. First, the project must remain entirely functional with Google Photos absent, failing, rate-limited, or removed — it is a source, not infrastructure, and nothing structural may come to depend on it. Second, a supply-chain review before any release is a matter of reading `Package.swift` and finding it empty, rather than auditing a tree.

This is a constraint worth stating as a principle rather than rediscovering per-decision, because it has consequences in at least three places.

**The database layer.** We call `sqlite3_*` directly from Swift, importing the system `SQLite3` module — no `Package.swift` dependency, no vendored source. The plumbing this obliges us to write is well-understood and finite:

- *A connection wrapper.* Open with `SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE | SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE | SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX`, set `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL`, `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` and a busy timeout on every connection. Estimated at 150 lines; `Database.swift` is about 390.
- *A statement wrapper.* Prepare, bind, step, finalize, with a small typed binding surface so call sites are not writing `sqlite3_bind_int64(stmt, 3, …)` by hand and miscounting indices. Cache prepared statements for the hot queries — picking a candidate, serving from the queue — since those run constantly. Estimated at another 150; `Statement.swift` is about 300.
- *A migrator.* A `user_version` pragma, an ordered array of migration closures, and a loop that applies the ones above the current version inside a transaction. Estimated at 40 lines; `Migrator.swift` is about 120, with tests from the first commit: apply from empty, apply from every intermediate version, and assert the resulting schema matches a freshly-created one.

  Worth knowing what this is *for*, though, given the database is disposable: it exists so that an update does not silently discard a library that took an hour to fetch, not because the data is precious. Before 1.0 the schema is edited in place and the answer to a mismatch is to delete the file. After 1.0 a migration is a courtesy that saves a re-download, and "delete and rescan" remains the fallback for anything a migration gets wrong.
- *Busy handling.* WAL permits one writer, so `SQLITE_BUSY` is a normal outcome under contention rather than an error. **`sqlite3_busy_timeout` is set to fifty milliseconds rather than left to wait**, because it waits by blocking the calling thread inside `sqlite3_step`, and on a cooperative-pool thread that starved the process — a picture took 122 seconds to serve on 2026-08-25. Every transaction retries with jittered exponential backoff in Swift instead, within the connection's five-second budget; the fifty milliseconds only absorbs WAL's brief checkpoint contention for statements run outside a transaction.

There is no in-process change observation to write, because we do not want it. An ORM's observation layer only sees its own process's writes, which in a design with an agent, a screensaver, and a widget all touching the same file would be actively misleading. Darwin notifications are the mechanism, and they were going to be regardless.

**Google Photos, whenever it lands.** The conventional integration pulls in the GoogleSignIn SDK. Without it, the OAuth flow is `ASWebAuthenticationSession` driving the authorization endpoint directly, a token exchange over `URLSession`, refresh tokens in the Keychain, and hand-written `Codable` structs for the Library API's JSON. This is more work than dropping in the SDK, but it is ordinary work — a few hundred lines of well-trodden OAuth — and it avoids taking a dependency on a large framework for one provider.

**Testing.** Swift Testing ships with the toolchain, so the test story needs nothing external either.

The cost of all this is real: a few hundred lines that a package would have provided, plus the obligation to maintain them. The benefit is that the entire shipping surface is code in this repository, there is no supply chain to audit before a Developer ID release or an App Store submission, and nothing can break because an upstream maintainer changed a minimum deployment target.

## The source model

A source is a row in a `source` table, never a setting. That distinction is the whole reason the system can grow a Google Photos provider at the end without touching the deck.

```sql
CREATE TABLE source (
  id                 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  uuid               TEXT,           -- (4) unique index; durable identity, names the cache directory
  kind               TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'folder' | 'file' | 'photos_collection' | 'photos_asset' | 'google_album'
  locator            TEXT NOT NULL,  -- path, PHAssetCollection id, PHAsset id, Google album id
  bookmark           BLOB,           -- security-scoped, stored from the first commit even unsandboxed
  stamp_uuid         TEXT,           -- file/folder sources only: matches the com.apple.metadata: xattr
  enabled            INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  recursive          INTEGER,        -- folder only
  available          INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,  -- the source itself, not its photos
  unavailable_reason TEXT,
  unavailable_at     INTEGER,
  added_at           INTEGER NOT NULL,
  scanned_at         INTEGER,
  title              TEXT,           -- (11) a Photos album's name, beside its identifier
  collection_kind    TEXT,           -- (11)
  folders            TEXT            -- (11) JSON array, outermost first
);
```

The deck is the union of every enabled source, and every provider answers the same small set of questions: *what identifiers are in you right now*, *give me the bytes for this identifier*, *is this photograph still there*, and *is the source itself there, and what is it called*. Enumeration and materialization, plus `existence`, `availability`, and — for a Photos album that stops resolving — `title`, `describe`, and `successors`. Nothing more. A provider knows nothing about the deck, the cache budget, or the display side.

Four consequences worth stating:

- **Mixed kinds coexist without special cases.** Two folders, forty individually pinned photos, your Favorites smart album, and later a Google album are twelve or a hundred rows in one table. Nothing anywhere branches on "which kind of library is this."
- **Individually selected photos are a source kind, not a folder with one entry.** `kind = 'file'` for a loose image on disk, `kind = 'photos_asset'` for one pinned asset in the Photos library. They enumerate to exactly one identifier. **`photos_asset` is declared and has no provider yet**; only collections are built. Modelling them as degenerate folders would have meant every folder-scan code path carrying a "but what if it is really just one file" branch, and it would have made "pin this specific photo from my library" impossible to express at all, since that photo has no path.
- **Disabling is not deleting.** `enabled = 0` drops a source's photos from the deck without discarding their deal history, so re-enabling a folder resumes where it left off rather than restarting its shuffle.
- **Duplicates across sources were accepted in v1, and are not any more.** Migration 9 gave every photograph an `identity` with a unique index, so the same file or asset reached from two sources is one row. See *One photograph, one row*.

**Recursion is a property of the folder, and it defaults off.** `recursive` is a column on the source row for the same reason `enabled` is: one wallpaper directory is flat and the album tree beside it is fifteen levels deep, and a run that could only pick one answer for both would force a person to add them in two commands or accept the wrong depth for one of them. Off by default because the surprising direction is the expensive one — walking a home directory by accident costs minutes and finds thousands of photos nobody meant to add, while missing a subdirectory costs one flag.

Both interfaces mirror the column. `--add-folder <path>` takes a folder as it finds it and `--add-folder --recursive <path>`, or `-r`, walks it — the flag belongs between `--add-folder` and its path, and anywhere else it is refused rather than applied to every folder, which is what a bare `-r` used to do. `PGR_FOLDERS` and `PGR_FOLDERS_RECURSIVE` are the environment forms, independent lists that may both be set, and `PGR_RECURSIVE=1` walks every entry of `PGR_FOLDERS`.

Scanning is incremental. Each source records `scanned_at`; a rescan streams the source into the pool, inserting what is not already there — with a null `last_dealt_seq` that makes a new photo immediately eligible without needing to be placed anywhere special — and noting what it saw, so that what it did not see can be removed afterwards. See *Scanning is constant-memory*.

### None of this is photograph-specific

Worth recording, because it is easy to lose sight of from inside a project named after photographs. **What has actually been built is a general server of shuffled items drawn from several disparate sources.** The pool, the deck's single shuffled order, the repeat window, the queue, the per-source providers, the byte-bounded cache, the availability model that tells "unplugged" from "deleted" — none of it knows what an item *is*. The only photograph-shaped parts are the renderer and the media-type filter, and both sit at the edges.

A music player is the obvious second instance: tracks from a local folder, a NAS, and a streaming service; one shuffle across all of them; a repeat window so a song you like comes back without coming back immediately; a cache that holds what has been fetched from the slow sources; and the same three-state answer when a drive is unplugged rather than a track deleted. It would reuse everything above the renderer.

This is not a plan to build one, and nothing here should be generalised on spec — *Expect the plan to change* argues against exactly that. It is recorded so the shape is recognised if a second consumer ever turns up, and as a check on the abstractions: a design that would need unpicking to serve songs instead of pictures has probably let the photograph leak somewhere it should not have.

## No videos until 2.0

Videos are out of scope. The important thing is that they are excluded *deliberately* — a filter with a name — rather than by simply not writing any video code, because the difference determines whether 2.0 is a feature or an excavation.

**Filtering, per provider.** For folder sources, filter on uniform type identifier conformance rather than an extension allowlist: `UTType(filenameExtension:)?.conforms(to: .image)`. That excludes `.mov` and `.mp4` without enumerating video formats, and it correctly *includes* image formats nobody remembered to list — HEIC, AVIF, JPEG XL, and the whole `.rawImage` family. For Photos sources, `PHFetchOptions.predicate` on `mediaType == PHAssetMediaType.image.rawValue` does it at the fetch, so videos never enter the row set at all.

**Live Photos are photos, and are included.** A Live Photo is `mediaType == .image` with `.photoLive` in its subtypes — a still with a movie attached. It passes the filter, which is right; it should display as its still. The one thing to get right is materialization: `PHAssetResource` for a Live Photo yields both a photo resource and a `.pairedVideo`, and we take only `.photo` or `.fullSizePhoto`. Taking the wrong one means a video file in a cache that has no idea how to display it.

**Animated stills are first frames, permanently.** Animated GIFs and animated HEIC conform to `.image`, so they pass the filter and land in the library. They display as their first frame and never animate — not as a v1 simplification to be revisited, but as a settled non-goal, unlike video. Nobody adds an animated GIF to a photo library so that a wallpaper can loop it.

Pleasingly, this costs nothing to implement and something to *un*-implement. `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(source, 0, …)` — the subsampled decode this plan already relies on — takes the frame at index 0, so the first frame is what falls out of writing no special code at all. The decision's real value is that a later phase never reaches for `CGAnimateImageAtURLWithBlock` trying to be helpful, which would put a frame animation and the screensaver's pan on the same layer, fighting over it.

**What the `media_type` column buys.** Storing the type on every row from the first migration means the exclusion lives in a query predicate, not in the scanner. Turning videos on in 2.0 becomes a change to what the deck selects rather than a re-enumeration of every source the user has ever added.

**Why 2.0 is genuinely harder, and why the column alone is not the whole answer.** Video is not a photo with extra bytes; it breaks assumptions the current design leans on:

- **Duration versus dwell.** A ten-second screensaver dwell and a three-minute clip disagree. Either the video is truncated, or the dwell becomes per-photo, which changes how the shared queue paces for every surface at once.
- **Not every surface can show one.** The wallpaper API takes a still image URL. A widget cannot animate. So video is a per-surface capability, which means the `consumer` table gains a capability mask and the deal query starts filtering by what the asking consumer can actually display — the first thing in this design that would make consumers pull from genuinely different subsets of the shared deck.
- **Audio needs a policy,** almost certainly "always muted," and a screensaver that unexpectedly makes noise is a bug people remember.
- **The cache cap stops making sense as a count.** A thousand videos is not a number of gigabytes anyone can predict, which is the point at which the byte ceiling stops being a safety valve and becomes the primary control.

None of that is v1 work. It is recorded here so that the two cheap things — the `media_type` column and the habit of writing per-surface capability as a concept rather than an assumption — happen now, while they cost nothing.

## Photos that disappear

**A photo removed from its source is removed from the pool.** The row is deleted. Its queue entries cascade away with it, and the bytes we were holding are deleted in the same operation.

This used to be a soft delete — `available = 0`, row retained — to keep the deal history, to keep a row for rename tracking to match against, and to survive an unplugged drive. Only the third of those turned out to matter, and it is handled somewhere else entirely.

**To the user these are transient images, and the design can treat them that way.** A photo's individual history is not worth a flag column, a second lifecycle, and a permanent ambiguity about what a row means. "Shown 40 times" is a statistic nobody acts on. Rename recovery is a nice-to-have built on stamps and Spotlight, not on retained rows. What is left is one rule with no exceptions: *removed means removed*, and a file that comes back is a new entry that competes immediately rather than resuming a place in a rotation it was absent from.

**The unplugged drive is handled by never getting there.** A source that loses *everything* at once is marked unavailable and its entries are not touched at all — see *the whole-source rule* below. So the delete path only ever runs for individual photos missing from a source that is demonstrably present, which is the only case where "removed" is unambiguous.

### Never showing a photo the user deleted

This is a requirement rather than a nicety, and it is the reason the display path does more work than it looks like it should.

> A user sees a picture they do not want in the rotation, so they delete it from the source. They must never see it again.

Some reasons a person deletes a photo are benign. Some are not, and those are the ones this exists for — the cost of being wrong is not a stale cache, it is showing somebody a picture they specifically acted to remove.

A periodic refresh cannot promise this on its own, because "eventually" is up to a scan interval. Worse, a *materialized* photo is our own copy: deleting the original does not touch our bytes, so a residency check would sail straight past it and display the photo happily.

**So every card is checked against its source immediately before it is displayed**, including ones we hold a copy of. Providers answer a three-valued question, and the third value is the whole point:

| answer | meaning | what happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `present` | still there | shown, from wherever its bytes are |
| `absent` | gone from a source that is *right there* | removed from the pool; our copy deleted with it |
| `unknown` | source unreachable — says nothing about the photo | cached bytes play; an undock costs nothing |

When the answer is `unknown`, the question moves up to the source, **which is in one of four states rather than two**:

| source | meaning | what happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| available | there, and readable | its photographs are shown, and anything missing can be fetched again |
| offline | cannot be reached — volume unmounted, share down, access refused | cached bytes play; nothing is removed; anything uncached is left undealt until it returns |
| gone | confirmed absent, on a volume that *is* mounted | its photographs leave the pool and the cache as each is reached |
| missing | a Photos album absent from a library that *is* readable — since 2026-09-07 | treated as offline: nothing is removed, and the panel offers Remove and Reconnect; see `Missing Albums Plan.md` |

Offline and gone are the same `stat` failure and mean opposite things, exactly as `absent` and `unknown` are. What separates them is whether the *volume* is mounted, plus whether the parent directory can be read — because a folder the agent has been refused access to is indistinguishable from one that is not there, and deleting a library over a permission prompt is the worst outcome this system can produce. A provider that cannot tell must answer offline; only a positive confirmation earns `gone`.

`absent` and `unknown` are one `stat` apart and conflating them is catastrophic in both directions. Treat `unknown` as `absent` and undocking a drive empties the library. Treat `absent` as `unknown` and the photo gets shown, which is the failure this section exists to prevent. When a provider is unsure which it is holding, the honest answer is `unknown` — but it must not reach for `unknown` merely because answering properly would be slow.

**Take the time to be right.** The display path has a generous latency budget: nobody perceives variation in how long a picture takes to change, so a network round trip is an acceptable price for a correct answer.

### Watching, and why it comes back for 1.0

Detection is by rescan for 0.1, and rescanning is genuinely cheap — measured against a twenty-thousand-photo folder rather than assumed:

- A full rescan with nothing changed takes about **2.4 seconds** for twenty thousand photos, call it six at fifty thousand. On a five-minute interval that is a two percent duty cycle.
- It is **invisible to a consumer dealing at the same time**. Dealing alone measured a median of 0.1 ms and a worst case of 19 ms; dealing while a full scan ran in another process measured a median of 0.1 ms and a worst case of 13.7 ms.

That second number is structural rather than lucky. Almost all of the 2.4 seconds is filesystem enumeration with no database lock held at all; writes are batched at about five hundred rows per transaction, each lasting microseconds; and WAL means a reader never blocks on a writer. The queue and the cache genuinely do run independently of refresh.

**`FSEventStream` on folder sources is nonetheless a requirement**, and the reason is the deletion rule above rather than latency. **Not built as of 2026-09-12**: neither `FSEventStream` nor `PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver` appears anywhere, and detection is still the rescan.

### Revoking a photo that is already on screen

This section previously argued that the play-time check fully covered every surface rendering *on demand* — the wallpaper, the screensaver, the Mac app — and that only pre-rendered surfaces like a widget or a Watch complication needed watching. **That was wrong, and the error is worth keeping because it is easy to make again: it conflates being checked at hand-off with being checked at display.**

Every surface holds its photo up for a while. A screensaver dwells ten seconds, the Mac app until you look away, the wallpaper for hours. The serve-time check guarantees we never *hand out* a deleted photo. It says nothing whatever about one already on the screen. Delete a file over `ssh` while the screensaver is running and it stays up there; delete one that is currently your desktop picture and it can sit there until something happens to rotate it. That is the rule in *Never showing a photo the user deleted* being broken by the surface with the longest dwell of all.

So there are two halves, and only the first is what "FSEvents" usually means:

- **Notice the deletion promptly.** `FSEventStream` for folder sources, `PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver` for Photos. Polling bounds this at a scan interval, which is far too long for a photo somebody deleted deliberately.
- **Tell the surfaces that are displaying it.** This does not exist in any form today. The mechanism is the one used everywhere else between our components: the agent removes the row and rings a payload-free topic — call it `.photoRevoked` — and every consumer checks whether the card it is currently showing still exists, which is one indexed lookup by photo id, and asks for a replacement if it does not. No payload to marshal, no per-client bookkeeping, and a consumer that missed the notification catches up on its next ordinary request.

For the widget and the Watch, that same topic is what drives `WidgetCenter.reloadTimelines`, which is the only lever that retracts an entry already rendered.

**The halves split.** Noticing was to land in Phase 3 with the Mac app — the app exists and noticing does not — because that is the first thing that holds a picture in front of a person: `pgr_ctl` prints a path and exits, so there is nothing on screen to retract and no way to observe the bug. **Retracting is post-0.1** — see *Deferred: retracting a photo already on screen*. 0.1 therefore ships with a photo able to linger on a surface after it is deleted, which is *Known shortcomings* item 6 and is accepted rather than overlooked.

**Does a shorter scan interval substitute?** Partly, and less than it looks. Scanning is now constant-memory and fast — 0.45s for 8,287 photos — so a thirty-second interval is a one-and-a-half percent duty cycle and would narrow the window considerably. But a scan of a million-photo source takes about two minutes, so the interval cannot be shortened where it matters most, and this project exists for libraries that large. Polling narrows the window; it cannot close it.

This is also a good illustration of why this document expects to be rewritten. The argument that deleted watching was sound on its own terms; a requirement arriving from a completely different direction reinstated it; and then the reinstated argument turned out to be scoped too narrowly as well.

### Tracking selected photos and folders through renames and moves — later

Individually selected photos and folder sources are identified by path today, which means renaming a folder or moving a file breaks the reference and the photo disappears.

**Scope: only what the user explicitly added.** Stamps go on the folders and individual files the user chose as sources — nothing else. Not the thousands of photos discovered by scanning inside a folder, not anything in the Photos library, not anything in our own caches. That is a handful of extended attributes rather than tens of thousands, it means we never write to a photo the user did not personally hand us, and it makes the whole mechanism `source`-level rather than `photo`-level.

**Which is why folder-sourced photos are stored folder-relative.** A photo found inside a folder source records its path *relative to* `source.locator`, not as an absolute path. Recover the folder and every photo inside it is recovered with it, in one update to one row — no per-photo repair, no Spotlight query per file, and correct even for a folder holding fifty thousand images. This is the design decision that makes the narrow scope sufficient rather than merely cheap.

**The technique, plus one refinement.** It comes from a file-syncing client Syd worked on, where users could add arbitrary files and folders to a sync set — the same problem shape as this one, and a strictly harder version of it, since a sync client that loses track of a file can destroy the user's data rather than merely dropping a photo out of a shuffle. It took a couple of weeks to arrive at. Recording it properly here so that time is spent once.

Stamp the source with an identity, then let Spotlight find it again:

1. On adding a folder or file source, generate a UUID and read its inode. Write both into an extended attribute on it — the UUID is what we will search for, the inode is what will tell original from copy.
2. Record the same UUID in the `source` row alongside the locator.
3. When the file is later found missing from its recorded path, run a Spotlight query for that UUID. An index lookup, so it is fast even across a large volume, and exact.
4. Iterate the results and compare each candidate's *current* inode against the inode stored in its stamp. Exactly one will match: the original.
5. Update the stored path and filename to the recovered location.
6. Strip the stamp from the non-matching candidates, since those are copies and their stamps are now lies.

The elegance is in step 4. A copy inherits the extended attribute but gets a fresh inode, so a copy is self-identifying — its stamp no longer describes it. A move preserves the inode, so the original keeps matching wherever it goes. One comparison separates the file we care about from any number of duplicates, without hashing content or comparing bytes.

The UUID is the refinement, and it is doing a different job from the inode rather than replacing it. Searching on the inode alone would work most of the time, but inode numbers are unique only within a volume and are reused after deletion, so the query could surface an unrelated file carrying a stale stamp with that number. A UUID makes the search exact and collision-free; the inode then does what only it can do. The cost is a few extra bytes in the xattr.

**Implementation detail that makes or breaks it:** ordinary extended attributes are not indexed. Spotlight imports xattrs whose names carry the `com.apple.metadata:` prefix and exposes them as queryable metadata attributes; the stamp must be written under that prefix, and queried through `NSMetadataQuery` or `mdfind`, or step 3 finds nothing.

**What this deliberately does not try to recover.** The contract is narrow on purpose: *the user renames or moves a folder, and we cope.* Everything else they do to the files inside is theirs to own.

So a photo renamed within its folder, moved into a subfolder, or moved between two folders that are both sources is not recognized as the same photo. It disappears from where it was and — if it landed somewhere we still watch — reappears as a new row, immediately eligible. Its deal history does not follow it.

That is a real loss and it is the right trade. Recognizing it would require per-photo stamps, which means writing extended attributes to every file in every folder the user ever added — exactly the thing the narrow scope exists to avoid. The failure mode is also benign: the photo is still in the deck, still shown, just treated as newly arrived. Nothing breaks, nothing vanishes permanently, and nobody has to reason about identity across a reorganization we were never asked to survive.

**Known limits**, the first two of which you already named:

- Same volume only. A cross-volume move is a copy-and-delete: new inode, and the original is genuinely gone.
- The volume must be Spotlight-indexed. External drives frequently are not, and network volumes usually are not.
- Some transfer paths strip extended attributes — `rsync` without `-X`, and copies onto filesystems that cannot carry them, such as exFAT.
- It writes to files we do not own — which is why the scope above is narrow. Only items the user explicitly handed us are ever stamped.
- macOS only. iOS has neither arbitrary-file Spotlight search nor xattr access outside the container, so bookmarks remain the mechanism there.
- Hard links produce multiple genuine matches sharing one inode. Any of them is correct; pick the first and do not treat the multiplicity as an error.

For completeness, the mechanisms available on Apple platforms are bookmark data (`URL.bookmarkData()`, which resolves through moves and renames and is the Apple-sanctioned answer), file reference URLs, and raw inode plus volume UUID. All three share a limitation worth knowing before choosing: they track a file within a volume, and none survives a copy-delete across volumes, which is what many applications do when they "move" a file. Whatever the approach, it wants to be a nullable column added to `photo` and `source` alongside the path rather than a replacement for it, so a stale identity falls back to path matching rather than failing outright.

**Does FSEvents make this unnecessary?** It did not, and it is no longer in the plan *for tracking renames* — watching for deletions, under *Watching*, is a separate matter — but the reasoning is worth keeping, because it is what showed the durable identity was load-bearing rather than a nicety.

FSEvents would have given live rename and move events within a watched tree, attributable by file ID, plus the ability to catch up across downtime from a stored event ID. What it never gave, and these are exactly the cases that matter here:

- **A folder moved out of the watched tree.** Rename the source folder itself and `kFSEventStreamEventFlagRootChanged` says the root moved, not where it went. Finding it again means resolving by file ID or bookmark — precisely the mechanism FSEvents was supposed to replace.
- **Downtime beyond log retention.** The event log is finite and can be discarded; a long enough gap, or a volume remounted elsewhere, and history is simply unavailable.
- **Cross-volume moves.** Copy-and-delete produces no rename event and a new inode. Nothing tracks that, by any mechanism.
- **iOS.** There is no FSEvents. Bookmarks are the only option there, so the durable identity is required regardless of what the Mac can do.

Every case FSEvents *could* have covered is one this design had already declined to solve — a photo moved inside a folder loses its history by choice, because per-photo stamps are the cost the narrow scope exists to avoid. So watching was buying attributable renames for files whose renames we do not track, and buying latency on a rescan that turns out to be free. **The durable identity is now the only path, rather than the recovery path behind a fast one**, which is a simplification rather than a loss: one answer to "where did this go" instead of two that have to agree.

## Sources live in preferences, not in the database

The `source` table is a copy. The list of what the user actually chose lives in `UserDefaults`, alongside every other preference.

This falls out of two decisions that were already made, and noticing that they collided is what forced it:

- **The database is disposable.** Deleting it and the cache is a legitimate recovery for any problem, costing one rescan.
- **Only preferences are durable**, because they are the one thing that cannot be reconstructed.

A source list in the database alone breaks both at once. Deleting the database would silently discard the folders someone chose, which turns "delete it and rescan" from a free recovery into a destructive one — and nothing about a path the user typed is derivable from anything else.

**So sources are a preference, and the table is a projection of it.** On launch the agent reconciles: anything in preferences that has no row gets one, anything in the table that is no longer a preference goes. A fresh database rebuilds the source list from preferences and rescans, and the user notices only that it took a moment.

**Since 2026-09-07 an entry for a Photos album carries three more keys — `title`, `collectionKind`, `folders` — and an entry for a folder carries none.** The identifier is still the identity and the only thing reconciliation matches on; the three are what the album was called and where it sat when it was added, captured by the agent in the same call that checks the album resolves, so a rebuilt database can name an album that has since stopped resolving. They are a seed: the row is renewed by every refresh that finds the album, and the row is what the panel reads. An entry from before this, or one written by hand without them, loads as it always did. See `Missing Albums Plan.md`.

**Configuration at launch writes through.** `--add-folder` and `PGR_FOLDERS` name sources; if they name one that is not yet a preference, it becomes one. So the first run is configured from the outside and every run after that is configured from preferences, without the launcher having to know which case it is in. A launcher that keeps passing the same folders is not doing anything wrong — it is asserting a state that is already true.

**What stays in the database** is everything derived from a source rather than chosen by a person: the photos found inside it, when it was last refreshed, and whether it is currently reachable. None of that survives a delete, and none of it needs to.

### The doorbell rings back at you

**Settled 2026-08-24 by the refresh announcing nothing at all.** The history is kept below because the fix it replaces looked correct, shipped, and was found racing only by watching a live agent.

The agent *observes* `.sourcesChanged` so a terminal adding a source is picked up within a tick, and writes made through `Preferences` post it — `pgr_ctl`'s, and the service's own on a client's behalf, which is how a `POST /v1/sources` gets scanned promptly. The agent also used to post it after any refresh that *found* changes, and Darwin notifications carry no sender, so its own announcement and a terminal's were indistinguishable.

Left alone that is a cycle: a refresh that finds a change announces it, the announcement schedules a refresh, and around it goes. It surfaced twice. A source that was merely *still* unavailable counted as news, so a missing folder drove the loop at the tick rate for ever — the visible symptom being the same alert printed every few seconds. And a folder being copied into changes truthfully on every pass, so even with that fixed the agent walked the directory continuously for as long as the copy ran.

Two rules were meant to settle it — **announce transitions, not states**, and **after any refresh, drop a pending ring** — and the second turned out to be a race. The drop ran microseconds after the post, but delivery arrives asynchronously on another queue, so the flag was usually raised *after* it was dropped and the next tick refreshed again. Measured live on 2026-08-24 against a folder mid-copy: sixty-eight refreshes of that source in twenty-one minutes — one every ~19 seconds against a 300-second scan interval — for as long as the copy ran.

**So the refresh-completion announce is deleted rather than guarded.** Nothing listened to it: clients ask over HTTP, the panel polls, and the only observer of `.sourcesChanged` was the agent itself — a service announcing its own scan results also ran against the direction rule that Darwin notifications flow from the outside world to the service, never back. *The doorbell, and the batching it still demands* had already declared the agent's publishing-back gone; this is the deletion that made it true of the refresh as well. The drop went with the announce: every ring on the topic is now somebody else changing the durable list, so one that lands mid-refresh keeps its promptness and is honoured on the next tick — re-walking a change the refresh already saw is cheaper than costing a terminal its promptness, the opposite trade from the one the drop made. The transition rule survives in what is *printed*: an unavailable source alerts when it goes, not on every pass.

The general form the first attempt taught, sharpened by how it ended: *a component that both posts and observes a payload-free notification cannot recognise its own announcements — so it must not announce its own work.* Idempotence was the patch; not ringing your own doorbell is the fix.

### This is also the control channel

Putting the source list in preferences makes `defaults write` a way to reconfigure a running service, with no cooperation from anything:

```
defaults write <domain> sources -array-add '<dict><key>kind</key><string>folder</string><key>locator</key><string>/Users/me/Pictures/Sunsets</string><key>recursive</key><true/><key>enabled</key><true/></dict>'
```

**The typed form, corrected 2026-09-12.** The old-style `{recursive = 1; enabled = 1;}` this example used stores both as the *string* `"1"`, which the source list does not read as a boolean — so that folder was added without recursion, and enabled only because enabled is the default.

The agent re-reads preferences on a thirty-second poll — the doorbell only makes it prompt — reconciles the table against the new list, and starts refreshing. Nothing had to be running for the write to work, and nothing had to be restarted for it to take.

That is worth stating plainly because of what it means for `pgr_ctl`: **the command-line tool is a convenience, not a requirement.** It knows the right domain and the right key names, and it rings the doorbell so the change is instant rather than within thirty seconds. But the service is controllable without it, which is the property that keeps the service's one job genuinely one job — it is configured by state it reads, not commanded through an interface it has to expose.

## The pool, the queue, and the refreshers

Three moving parts, and the point of naming them separately is that none of them knows how the others work.

**The pool is every photo the system knows about**, from every source. It has an API — put entries in, take entries out — and that API is the only way anything reaches it.

**The refreshers put things in and take things out.** One task per source, running concurrently, each against its own database connection. A source is enumerated, diffed against what the pool holds for it, and the difference applied. A refresher touches the queue never, and knows about other sources not at all.

**The queue maintainer always runs.** It deals cards from the pool to keep the queue at its target, on its own clock rather than waiting to be asked — the bytes are fetched by a separate queue that filling feeds — and serves the head to whoever asks. It does not know what a provider is. It does not know a refresh is happening.

Dealing was paced to pictures served until 2026-08-25. See *Dealing happens whether or not anybody asked*: prefetching only while somebody is watching is a poor trade once a single fetch can take five minutes.

That separation is what makes the concurrency safe to have. A folder on a dead network share takes its timeout inside its own task; a provider that hangs hangs alone; and the queue goes on dealing throughout, because a refresh is a series of short write transactions against a database that permits readers continuously. It is also why the earlier measurement holds: the queue's latency was unchanged with a full twenty-thousand-photo scan running beside it.

**Concurrency is scheduling, so it belongs to the host.** The kit exposes "refresh this one source" and has no opinion about how many run at once; the Mac agent runs a task group with a cap, and an iOS host with a few hundred milliseconds of background time can run exactly one. That is the same seam that keeps timers out of the kit.

### Scanning is constant-memory, and what it took

**The only photos this system holds in memory are the ones in flight** — one streaming out of a provider, bytes being fetched, an image being handed to a client. Everything else is in the database, which is what the database is for. A scan of a million photos and a scan of eight thousand now cost the same.

That took three fixes. Only the first was visible by reading the code; the other two were found by bisecting a standalone probe against directories of the real size, and neither was where anyone predicted.

**The library was held in memory three times over.** The provider returned its whole enumeration as an array, the scanner loaded every existing row into a dictionary to diff against, and it built a `Set` of every external identifier to find what had departed. All three are gone. `enumerate` takes a sink and pushes one photo at a time; additions are `INSERT OR IGNORE` in batches of five hundred, so *is this already known* is a question for the database rather than for a dictionary. Removals first paged through the pool five hundred rows at a time and asked the provider about each photo, with no diff at all. **That took eighty-five minutes on a network volume, and was replaced**: the walk now records every identifier it saw in a `walk_seen` temp table, and removal is one query for the pool rows the walk did not see, five hundred at a time — a diff again, but one the database holds rather than memory. A source whose walk reaches nothing is marked unavailable instead, and a deleted photograph is still caught at serve time by the existence check.

**`.isUbiquitousItemKey` cost about 9 KB per file.** It was prefetched so a photo in iCloud Drive could be classified as materialized. Every answer drags iCloud bookkeeping with it and not all of it comes back when the URL goes: 212 MB for a 20,000-photo walk against 28 MB without it, and 787 MB against 74 MB at 80,000. Asking lazily per file was no better. **iCloud Drive is a subtree**, so the question is now asked once of the source root — a folder inside it has every file ubiquitous, a folder outside it has none.

**Building an absolute path per file cost 94 MB per 80,000, and the fix was to stop needing one.** The walk had no business handling paths at all: what it wants is each photo's identifier *relative to its source*, and it was recovering that by taking the child's absolute path and stripping the root off the front.

That prefix arithmetic was never as simple as it sounds. Foundation resolves symlinks in the children an enumerator yields but not in the root it was handed, so a source under `/var/…` produces children under `/private/var/…` and no single prefix matches. `standardizedFileURL` per file papered over it at 53 MB per 80,000 files, and three candidate prefixes computed once per walk replaced that for free — but both were solving a problem that only existed because the relative path had been thrown away and was being reconstructed.

**`.producesRelativePathURLs` is Foundation's own answer**, and it deletes the whole category. The enumerator reports what it descended through, `url.relativePath` is the identifier, and the `/var` case resolves on its own because Foundation is tracking the descent rather than being reverse-engineered from a string.

It also retired an `autoreleasepool`. One was genuinely load-bearing while the loop built absolute paths — `path(percentEncoded:)` mints an Objective-C temporary and a tight Swift loop crosses no pool boundary to drain it, so 94 MB accumulated across 80,000 files against 12 MB with a pool. `relativePath` does not allocate one, so the pool now measures 12.5 MB against 12.4 MB without it and costs 0.3s per 80,000 files. **It is gone from the walk, and that is the better outcome: not draining an allocation, but not making it.** The pool that remained around the per-row existence sweep went with the sweep, and there is no `autoreleasepool` left anywhere in the code.

`URL` and `URLResourceValues` are Swift structs throughout and never needed a pool of their own — worth stating because a pool in a loop reads as a thing one always does, and here it was load-bearing in exactly one place for exactly one reason, until it was not needed at all.

**Filenames were verified byte for byte before this changed**, because a mangled identifier is a photo that can never be opened again. `url.relativePath` returns the exact UTF-8 the filesystem reported — not merely a canonically equivalent string — across NFC and NFD spellings of the same name, emoji, CJK, Arabic, Hangul, stacked combining marks, embedded quotes, a filename containing a newline, and an NFD-named subdirectory. Every one reopens by root-plus-identifier. APFS refuses to create a filename that is not valid UTF-8, so the one case that could not be tested here is an exFAT or SMB volume that permits one.

**What it measures now**, the same code against 8,287 real photos, an 80,000-file nested tree, and a synthetic tree of a million files:

| | 8,287 photos | 80,000 files | 1,000,000 files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| walk | 21.8 MB, 0.45s | — | 22.0 MB, 21s |
| full ingest | 23.6 MB, 0.31s | 30.8 MB, 2.8s | 30.8 MB, 83s |
| rescan, including the removal sweep | 23.8 MB, 0.59s | — | 32.5 MB, 136s |

Underneath all of those is a floor of 6.4 MB of Swift runtime and Foundation, plus 1.4 MB to open and migrate the database. **A million files cost about 14 MB over an idle process, and going from eight thousand to a million moved the number by 0.2 MB.** The running agent sits flat at 28 MB through startup, queue fill, and rescans, with no scan spike left to see.

**A hand-rolled `readdir` walker was measured and rejected**, and the numbers are worth keeping so nobody re-opens it on a hunch. With every decision the kit actually makes preserved — `UTType` conformance rather than an extension list, package directories not descended, storage classified per device — it ran 0.40s against 0.98s at 80,000 files and produced identical counts on the real library, 8,287 images and 3 videos. But its memory was a wash at 13.9 MB against 12.3 MB, because loading `UTType` dominates either way, and the 5.8 MB figure that first made it look dramatic came from a version cheating with a hardcoded extension list. Two and a half times the speed, none of the memory, in exchange for owning hidden-file handling, package detection, symlink loops, and filename encoding across every filesystem macOS mounts. **Foundation handles the myriad special cases; that is what it is for.**

The durable lesson is about method rather than about memory. Five explanations were argued confidently before any was tested — the enumerator retaining URLs, autorelease pressure in general, SQLite's page cache, `UTType` conformance, and later that the pool was permanently necessary — and every one was wrong, including a pool that was added on a bad theory, removed on a null result from a probe that did not exercise the real culprit, added back when a better probe found it, and finally deleted when the allocation it drained stopped happening. What settled each round was a standalone program with one ingredient removed at a time, run against a directory of the size that matters. Rebuild that probe rather than reasoning around the next number that looks wrong.

### What a client asks for, and what it gets back

Consumers do not block on any of this. The exchange is:

1. The client asks for a picture, at the resolution it is about to draw at.
2. The service takes the head of the queue, confirms the picture is still in its source, and renders it to that size.
3. It answers with the bytes, or with *there are no photos available*.
4. On the first the client displays what it was handed. On the second it shows its empty state.

**The client never touches the database or the cache**, which is what lets a screensaver inside someone else's sandbox and an Apple TV on the far side of the Wi-Fi be the same kind of thing. The exchange needs no callback, because a card whose bytes are not local costs the request at most a short wait — `serveWaitSeconds`, two seconds by default — for the head card's fetch, after which every cold card is dropped on sight; the queue's fetcher fetches every queued card head first, so the bytes are usually there before their turn. What remains at request time is a subsampled decode and a re-encode, **measured at 109 ms median and about a second for a 38 MB original** — see Phase 3. This document said "tens of milliseconds" until 2026-09-06, which was an order of magnitude out. See *The service is the interface* and *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*.

It also means **"no photos" is an ordinary reply rather than an error**. A fresh install has an empty queue and an empty cache, so the first few requests answer *nothing available* and photos begin arriving as downloads succeed. Every surface has a defined empty state already; this just gives it something to be triggered by.

### A source removed while it is being scanned

A walk of a large folder runs for minutes and writes in batches of five hundred *(pages of 100, read before the lock, since 2026-09-16 — `Agent Performance Overhaul.md`, Phase 4)*. Removing that source deletes its row, every `photo` row cascades away with it, and the next batch inserts a `source_id` that no longer names anything.

`INSERT OR IGNORE` does not cover this: SQLite's conflict clause handles `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK` and primary keys, and a foreign key is not a conflict to be resolved. It reached the user on 2026-08-26 as a page of raw SQL beside the words *source 8 unavailable*.

`refresh` now recognises the failure, confirms the source row is actually gone rather than assuming it, and abandons the scan quietly. Marking it unavailable was writing a status onto a row that is not there — and `unavailable` means *these photographs cannot be reached*, which is a claim about an unplugged drive and not about something the user has deleted.

### Removing a source, and the bytes it used to leave behind

`remove(id:)` deletes the row and unlinks the whole cache directory, keyed by the source's uuid. That part was right and tested. Two things around it were not, both found on 2026-08-26 by counting rather than by anything failing: a cache root holding **36 source directories for a library with 3 sources**, and 253 cached originals against 238 rows.

**One source failing stranded the rest of its batch.** Reconciling removes every no-longer-listed source in a loop, and each removal takes the writer — so a busy database, or a scan of one of those sources still in flight, threw part way and abandoned everything after it. Preferences had already forgotten them, so they were gone from the panel with their rows and their bytes still on disk, waiting for a reconcile that only came at the next launch. Each removal is now wrapped: the failure is logged with which source and why, the loop carries on, and the source stays in the table so the next reconcile tries it again.

**The launch sweep left the husks.** `PhotoStore.rebuild(photos:)` deletes files nothing claims and never touched directories, so every source cleaned up that way left an empty directory behind — twenty-eight of them had accumulated. The sweep now removes a source directory once it has taken the last file in it. An empty directory is not a source waiting for bytes: directories are created by the first file written into them.

**And it said none of this out loud.** Both counts went to `Log.cache.notice` and `PhotoCache.prepare()` discarded the result, so the launch that reclaimed 15 files and 33 directories printed nothing where anybody was looking. `prepare()` returns what it reclaimed now, and the agent prints a line for each kind it reclaimed — leftover resize directories, and unclaimed files with their empty directories — silent on a clean launch.

## Rows versus bytes

The single most important thing to keep straight in this design is that there are two populations, and only one of them is bounded.

**Rows are complete and cheap.** Every photo in every enabled source gets a row in `photo` — identifier, source, shuffle key, deal ordinal, a few timestamps. Call it 200 bytes. A 50,000-photo Favorites album is a 10 MB table, and SQLite does not care. Enumeration is cheap on both providers: `PHFetchResult` is lazy and returns identifiers without touching pixels, and a directory walk is I/O-bound but trivial next to reading the files.

**Bytes are windowed and expensive.** The cache holds actual image files for a bounded number of bytes — `cacheByteCeiling`, **1 GB by default since 2026-09-06**, down from 10 GB. See *The resize cache is removed* for where the number comes from.

Keeping these separate is what makes the shuffle honest. If the database only held the 1000 photos that happen to be cached, the shuffle would be a shuffle of 1000 photos, and the other 49,000 would surface only through whatever refill policy pulled them in. With complete rows, the deck shuffles the entire library and the cache is purely a performance layer — a staging area for the queue's cards, and since 2026-09-06 no longer described as a prediction about which photos are needed soon — never a constraint on what can appear.

### Transient bytes: cache them, then let them go back to being transient

**If a provider can take the bytes out from under an entry, cache them and treat the original as transient rather than authoritative.** That is the general rule, and `referenced` versus `materialized` is one instance of it rather than the whole idea.

The failure it prevents is specific and nasty, because it does not look like an error. An evicted iCloud Drive file is a *dataless stub*: it is present, `stat` succeeds, and the existence check passes — and then reading it either blocks on a download or fails outright, on the display path, at the moment a surface wants to draw. Volume properties cannot see this coming, because the volume is the internal boot disk and answers "internal, local, not removable." It is the file that is remote, not the disk.

Materializing moves that download into the queue's fetcher, where slowness is affordable: a card is fetched from the moment it is dealt, and a request waits at most two seconds for the head.

**Every provider that can do this gets the same treatment.** iCloud Drive today, Google Photos in Phase 11, a Photos library whose originals live in iCloud, a network share that goes away mid-session. The question is never "which kind of source is this" but "can the bytes disappear while the row stays valid" — and wherever the answer is yes, the bytes come into the cache and the original is treated as a hint about where they came from.

Once cached, the entry is an ordinary materialized photo and the original is free to revert to whatever transient state its provider likes. Eviction — least recently wanted; see *Eviction* — is the only thing that decides when we stop holding it, exactly as for every other materialized photo.

**Today this is approximated per source, and that is a deliberate trade.** `sourceIsUbiquitous` asks whether the source root lives in iCloud, once per scan, and marks everything under it materialized. It answers *lives in iCloud* rather than *is currently evicted* — so a fully-downloaded iCloud folder is copied unnecessarily. The precise question is `.ubiquitousItemDownloadingStatusKey`, which is per file, and per-file iCloud properties are what cost 787 MB across an 80,000-photo walk. Coarse and constant beats precise and linear.

**Doing this properly waited for something that exercises a slow, failable fetch**, and that now exists: the queue's fetcher, with `FetchDeadline` and `SourceBench`, fetching Photos originals every day — not `pgr_ctl`, which has no download path. The per-file question is still not asked; coarse remains the choice, for the memory reason above.

## One photograph, one row

`SchemaV1` declined deduplication and said why, reserving a nullable `content_hash` for whenever it was wanted. That column was never added, because identity turned out to be free.

`photo.identity` is written at intake and carries a unique index. The rule has two currencies:

- **A Photos asset is its own `localIdentifier`.** One asset in twelve collections is one string, already stored in `external_id`. Nothing is read, hashed, or compared.
- **A file is its absolute path** — `source.locator` joined to `external_id`. The relative form is what `external_id` holds, so `~/Pictures` walked recursively and `~/Pictures/2024` added beside it store the same file twice under two different relative paths and never conflicted. A file source's locator *is* the photograph, matching the branch `FileAccess.withPhotoURL` takes, so one file added on its own and again inside a folder is also one row.

**Strict identity, never resemblance.** Nothing here compares images. Two photographs that look alike — the same scene at two resolutions, an edited version beside its original, a JPEG next to its HEIC — are two photographs, and both are kept and both are shown. What is deduplicated is *the same file* reached by more than one route, and the test is an identifier rather than a likeness. This is the line `SchemaV1` was gesturing at with "perceptual hashing, edited versions, format conversions", and it is on the far side of it: that was the hard problem, and it is not being solved, attempted, or approximated.

**Why the change happened now.** Overlapping folders were always possible and rare enough to live with. Checking twelve boxes in a collection picker makes overlap the normal case: a photograph is in Recents, in Favorites, and in the album it was put in. The same asset would have been cached three times, dealt three times, and shown as repeats that look like a deck bug.

**The row belongs to whichever source reached it first**, and `INSERT OR IGNORE` means a later source's copy simply does not land. Unchecking that first collection takes the photograph with it until the remaining sources are rescanned. The correct answer is a junction table, which changes the deal query and the cascade both; the cheap answer is a rescan, and the cheap answer is what is here.

**Two consequences worth expecting rather than discovering.** A collection whose photographs are all already known reports nothing added, which is dedup working and reads like a failed scan. And the picker's count and the source row's count will disagree, because the picker asks PhotoKit — which counts an asset in every collection holding it — while the row counts only what landed.

**A recurring startup pass was considered and rejected.** With the unique index in place a new duplicate cannot be inserted at all, so such a pass could only ever return zero rows — and would read, to whoever found it later, as though duplicates were expected. The migration collapses what was already there once; cache files belonging to rows it deleted are reclaimed by the next launch's index build, which is built from the filesystem and deletes what nothing claims.

## The deck algorithm

The naive shuffle — one random column, re-rolled when consumed — repeats photos almost immediately, because a fresh random value can land right back at the front. The fix is to make recency a filter rather than trusting the ordering alone.

**In normal operation the deck is a circular queue that never runs dry.** A photo is eligible once more than *w* deals have gone by since it was last dealt, so at any moment `N − w − 1` of the pool's `N` photos are available to choose from — and since 2026-08-26 that pool is **what can be shown right now**, the cache plus whatever is read in place, rather than the whole library — **reversed 2026-09-05: the pool is every available photograph again**, see *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*, **and since 2026-09-07 an unavailable source contributes only the photographs the cache holds** — a rotating window of candidates that refills itself as fast as it is consumed. Nothing ever ends; there is no boundary and no reshuffle.

That holds for every fraction below 1.0 on a library of any real size. The **pass** is the floor underneath it, for the two cases where the window has no answer: at fraction 1.0, where `w` is the whole pool by construction, and on a library whose dealable population is within `w + 1`. Then, and only then, the deck reshuffles and a new pass begins.

**So: a photo is eligible when more than *w* deals have gone by since it was dealt, or when it has not been dealt in the current pass.** That is the whole algorithm, and the second clause is the one that almost never fires.

```sql
CREATE TABLE photo (
  id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  source_id       INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES source(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  external_id     TEXT NOT NULL,     -- PHAsset localIdentifier, Google media item id, or

);

CREATE TABLE deck_state (
  id             INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (id = 1),
  deal_seq       INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   -- advances on every card played
  pass_start_seq INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0    -- the ordinal the current pass began at
);

-- Selection orders by shuffle_key and takes a LIMIT, so the index leads with
-- the equality columns and *ends* at shuffle_key. Putting last_dealt_seq before

CREATE INDEX photo_deck ON photo(source_enabled, media_type, shuffle_key);
CREATE INDEX photo_window ON photo(source_enabled, media_type, last_dealt_seq);
CREATE INDEX photo_source ON photo(source_id);
-- cached_at (migration 7) records which photographs the cache holds. It was the
-- deck's pool from 2026-08-26 to 2026-09-05; now it orders eviction, feeds the

-- The filesystem is still the truth: the index is rebuilt from it at launch
-- and this column is reconciled against that walk, disk winning.
CREATE INDEX photo_resident ON photo(source_enabled, media_type, cached_at);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX photo_uuid ON photo(uuid);          -- (4)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX photo_identity ON photo(identity);  -- (9)
```

A single monotonic counter — the deal ordinal — advances on every card dealt anywhere in the system. The pass is one more integer beside it: a photo is unused in the current pass while `last_dealt_seq <= pass_start_seq`, and reshuffling means moving `pass_start_seq` up to the current ordinal, which makes every photo unused again. There is no per-photo epoch column and no pass-position column.

The two rules collapse into a single comparison, which is why there is no branch anywhere in the deal:

```
eligible  ⟺  last_dealt_seq IS NULL OR last_dealt_seq <= max(pass_start_seq, deal_seq - w - 1)
```

Photos never dealt are eligible by definition, so a newly added photo joins the pass already in progress rather than waiting for the next one — no placement, no special case.

### The repeat window

**Reversed 2026-09-05; see *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*.** **Superseded 2026-08-26 by *Deck and Queue v2.md*.** **Still the algorithm, and the population it was briefly measured against is gone.** From 2026-08-26 to 2026-09-05 the pool was what could be shown — the cache plus whatever is read in place — so a photograph came back after half the *cache*; it is every available photograph again, so it comes back after half the library.

*w* is derived from a configurable fraction of the eligible pool: `w = round(fraction × pool_size)`, with **0.5 as the starting default** — a photo can come back once about half the library has gone by, without waiting for the pass to finish.

At **fraction 1.0** the window is the whole pool and is therefore never satisfiable on its own, so the pass is the only rule: exactly one showing per pass, in a fresh random order every time through, which is the classic shuffle. At **0.5** or **0.33** photos recur sooner, which matters most on large libraries — with fifty thousand photos, fraction 1.0 means a picture you loved is effectively never coming back, and that is a strange thing for a system whose purpose is showing you your photos.

The two rules hand off cleanly rather than fighting, and the handoff is lopsided. The eligible set has `N − w − 1` members, so below 1.0 the window always has an answer on any library where `N − w − 1 ≥ 1`: the deck never runs down to nothing, `pass_start_seq` never moves, and the minimum-gap guarantee is `w + 1`. At 1.0 the window contributes nothing and the pass does all the work. Nothing in between needs describing, because the `max()` picks whichever is looser at each deal.

The practical shape of that: at the default 0.5 with four thousand photos, two thousand cards are eligible at every single deal and the pass machinery is dead code that never executes. It earns its place only at the extremes — the slider pushed fully right, or a library of a handful of photos where `w` swallows the pool. Both are real, so the floor stays; neither is the common case, so the circular queue is what the code should read as.

The trade is fairness against liveliness, and it should be stated plainly. Fraction 1.0 gives exact fairness: every photo shown the same number of times, zero variance. Lower fractions equalize only in expectation — over any finite stretch some photos appear three times while others appear once. That variance *is* the feature being bought, and it is why the number is exposed rather than chosen for the user.

It lives in `UserDefaults` as `repeatWindowFraction`, settable by `pgr_ctl set` from day one and worth a slider in the settings GUI later, since it is the one parameter whose effect a person can actually feel.

### Why this removes machinery rather than adding it

An earlier version of this plan used an epoch counter — order by `(epoch, shuffle_key)`, bump the epoch on deal — with a per-photo epoch column, a pass-position column, a key-biasing scheme, and a separate time-based cooldown to patch the boundary. All of that is deleted. What survives is one integer, `pass_start_seq`, in a table that has one row.

**The boundary is accepted rather than patched, and that is the deliberate change.** A photo dealt as the last card of one pass can be dealt again as the first card of the next. The cooldown existed to prevent exactly that, and it is not worth its weight: this is a photo shuffle, not a casino, and someone who happens to be watching at the moment two passes meet — every few weeks, on a real library — sees a picture twice. The alternative costs a guard band, a relaxation path, and a paragraph of explanation, to buy nothing anybody asked for.

A pure sliding window with no pass would have no boundary at all, which is why an earlier draft of this section preferred one. It does not survive contact with fraction 1.0. A window of `pool` cards leaves exactly one photo eligible at every deal after the first pass, so the shuffle key never gets a say and every pass replays the first pass's order forever — exact fairness bought with a fixed rotation. Reshuffling at a pass boundary is what makes 1.0 an actual shuffle, and the boundary is the price.

**The degradation rule is unchanged and still essential: the deal must never fail.** But running out of eligible cards is no longer a failure to degrade around — it is the end of a pass, which is ordinary business, and the reshuffle is strictly more permissive than any window could be. So the progressive halving is gone with the rest of the epoch machinery. And there is nothing left below that: a source with nothing to offer simply offers nothing, the queue stays short, and a client asking gets *no photos available*. That is the whole degradation story now — fewer pictures, never an error.

**Refined 2026-08-24: zero eligible is three states, and only one of them ends a pass.** Queued and claimed cards are staged, not used up, so a count that excludes them can reach zero while the pass has plenty left — and treating that as a pass end reshuffled on every picture served and nullified the window on any library small enough for the queue to hold its eligible set. Now: everything dealable already in play deals nothing; a population the window can free waits, since serving keeps advancing the ordinal and the window opens on its own; and only a population within `w + 1` — the two cases above, with retired photographs excluded because they can never cycle — reshuffles. Found by audit rather than by running it, and reproduced as failing tests before the fix.

`times_shown` survives purely as a statistic, for the deck inspector and for `pgr_ctl deck stats`. Nothing orders by it.

### Selecting at a random offset, not at the minimum

**Among the eligible, take a card at a uniformly random offset** in `shuffle_key` order. Not the first one.

This is worth stating explicitly because the obvious formulation — `ORDER BY shuffle_key LIMIT 1`, with the key re-rolled on deal — starves photos permanently, and does so silently. `LIMIT 1` on an ordering takes the *minimum*, and only the winner's key is re-rolled. A photo whose key lands high loses, keeps its high key precisely *because* it never won, and loses again. In simulation at fraction 0.5 over twenty thousand deals of a hundred photos, showings ranged from 3 to 391 and a photo with an initial key of 0.999 was never shown at all. Taking a random offset instead gives 186 to 217.

Fraction 1.0 hides the flaw, because a pass guarantees every photo a turn whatever its key — which is exactly why it is worth a paragraph rather than a footnote. The bug lives only in the range the deck actually ships in.

`shuffle_key` keeps both of its jobs. It supplies the index that makes selection cheap, and its re-roll on showing churns the order so consecutive requests to one source do not walk the same neighbourhood.

### Selecting and showing

Selection and showing are two statements rather than one, and the atomic guarantee sits in a third place entirely.

```sql
-- Pick a candidate from the one shuffle over everything. :threshold is
-- max(pass_start_seq, deal_seq - w - 1), and :offset is a uniform draw over the
-- count of eligible pictures, taken in the same transaction.
SELECT p.id, p.uuid, p.source_id, s.uuid AS source_uuid, p.external_id, p.storage,
       p.original_filename
  FROM photo p JOIN source s ON s.id = p.source_id
 WHERE p.source_enabled = 1
   AND p.media_type = 'image'
   AND (s.available = 1 OR p.cached_at IS NOT NULL)
   AND (p.last_dealt_seq IS NULL OR p.last_dealt_seq <= :threshold)
   AND p.render_failures < 3
   AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM queue q WHERE q.photo_id = p.id)
 ORDER BY p.shuffle_key
 LIMIT 1 OFFSET :offset;

-- …append it to the queue, which refuses a photograph it already holds. No
-- claim and no fetch: both belong to the queue's fetcher. Much later, when it
-- is served:
BEGIN IMMEDIATE;
UPDATE photo
   SET times_shown = times_shown + 1, last_dealt_seq = :seq,
       shuffle_key = <new random>, last_shown_at = :now, claimed_at = NULL
 WHERE id = :id;
UPDATE deck_state SET deal_seq = :seq WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;
```

**Marking shown happens when a picture is served, not when it is queued.** A picture prepared but never shown — because the user quit, or the source went away — costs the rotation nothing.

**The atomicity lives in the queue pop.** An earlier version of this plan fused selection and marking into one `UPDATE … RETURNING`, so that two processes racing were serialised by SQLite and the loser got the next card. That is no longer possible, because a card waits on the queue — and its bytes are fetched — between the two halves. What replaced it is stronger where it matters and weaker where it does not:

- Two producers *can* pick the same candidate. Appending refuses a photo already queued, so the loser deals nothing: the cost is nothing, and never a duplicated showing.
- Two consumers *cannot* get the same picture. Serving removes the queue entry under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, so exactly one wins.

Counting the eligible pictures to draw the offset is a second statement. Against fifty thousand photos it is an index scan rather than a table scan, and it happens once per picture produced rather than once per photo.

**`source_enabled` is denormalized onto `photo`.** The pool is the union of every *enabled* source, and joining `source` on every selection would cost the index that makes the ordering free. It is maintained in the same transaction that enables or disables a source — one write against that source's rows, on an operation nobody performs in a loop. **Since 2026-09-07 the deal joins `source` regardless**, to read `available` — an unavailable source deals only what is held — and `source_enabled` stays denormalised because the indexes lead with it.

## Surviving a source that will not answer

**The refresh no longer blocks the loop, 2026-08-26.** Every source was walked inside the tick, so nothing else ran meanwhile — no maintenance, no eviction, no preference re-read. The `walk_seen` diff took a 5,093-photograph source from eighty-five minutes to 1.1 seconds and that read as solved; a network share of 4,510 put it back to **30.9 seconds**. The pass is detached now, admitted one at a time by a latch, and reports back so the loop stamps its own heartbeat. A `--once` run still waits, having nothing else to do.

**Superseded 2026-08-26 by *Deck and Queue v2.md*.** **The four faults and their fixes survive; the code moved.** The deadline and the abandon-rather-than-await decision are `FetchDeadline`; the backoff is `SourceBench`; both are reached from the queue's fetcher, `QueueFetcher`, since 2026-09-05 — the cache's own refresher that had replaced the queue of pictures to cache went too. The third fault — the population asked about not being the population answered from — cannot recur: there is one population now.

Written 2026-08-26, the night an iCloud Drive folder of 436 album covers stopped answering at all — `bird` idle at 0% CPU, metadata served, content never delivered — while it was 98% of the library. Four separate faults, each of which stopped pictures reaching the screen, and each fixed differently.

**A read that never returns held its lane for ever.** No provider had a timeout, because none had needed one. One undownloaded file left `executing` at 1, `FillerBox.Gauge.isShort` counts a card in flight as the queue's, and a nineteen-card queue therefore read as full against a target of twenty — for as long as the agent ran, silently. Fixed with a per-photograph deadline that releases the lane.

**The abandoned work then ate the runtime.** A deadline cannot stop a blocking `copyItem`, so the freed lane started another while the first kept running. Eleven accumulated and took every thread in the cooperative pool: not a deadlock, nothing left to run on. Bounding the work fixed it and converted a starvation into a stall — correct, and useless. `BlockingWork` is the real answer, and only once it existed could the bound be removed.

**The deck then refused to repeat.** `chooseCandidate` ends a pass only when the population is small enough that waiting can never free anybody, on the sound reasoning that serving keeps advancing the ordinal. Asked for a *servable* card it measured the whole library — 445 against a 223 window — concluded that waiting would work, and waited. The photographs with bytes were 133, every one inside the window, and nothing was serving, so the ordinal never moved. **The population a question is asked about has to be the population it is answered from**; `dealablePopulation(servableOnly:)` is that fix, and it is the one most likely to be undone by someone reading only the existing comment about waiting being the answer. **The servable-only population went on 2026-09-05, and the parameter with it**: `dealablePopulation()` takes none, and the rule survives as the pool and the candidates sharing one predicate — which since 2026-09-07 is what an unavailable source holds.

**And the last resort trickled.** Dealing three cards produced *empty answer, three pictures, empty again*; measured at fifteen served against thirty-two empty. It fills the queue now. ~~The launch bridge still deals a handful, and should.~~ The launch bridge went on 2026-09-05; see *Cold start*.

### Two questions this left open

Neither is decided, and both are deliberately not decided — recorded so the next person does not have to rediscover them.

**Sixty seconds is too short for iCloud Drive, and it is not obvious what the right number is.** Measured 2026-08-26 while the service was merely slow rather than dead: 5–15 MB files landing at about seventy-five seconds against a sixty-second bound. They time out, their card goes back to the pool, and the fetch then completes anyway and re-queues the photograph — so the bytes are not wasted, but the deck churns for nothing. `FileClassifier.isUbiquitous` already tells the folder provider whether a source's root is in iCloud, so the deadline could ask the same question and give those a longer one. **Left alone on purpose**: raising the number would have hidden the resilience question behind it, and the night suggests the backoff matters more than the bound does. What is not known is whether seventy-five seconds is typical or was that afternoon's weather.

**`enumerate` is still on the cooperative pool.** `materialize` moved to `BlockingWork`; the folder walk did not, and it blocks in exactly the same way — `FileAccess`'s own comment records four concurrent walks stopping the agent from answering picture requests in August, which is the same failure from the other end. It is not a straight wrapper: the walk pushes into an `async` sink that writes to the database, so moving it wants the sink and the walk to end up on the right sides of the boundary. Nothing has forced the issue yet because refreshes are rarer than fetches, and a wedged share would.

What the night established, beyond the fixes: **the design survived a total dependency failure**. With 98% of the library unreachable the agent went on serving from local bytes, without wedging, without a restart, and degraded in cadence rather than stopping. That is the property the whole cache-and-queue architecture exists for, and it had never been tested against anything worse than a slow disk.

## Consumers, and how a picture reaches one

There used to be an elaborate answer here: every display was a virtual consumer that reserved a *hand* — a private, contiguous block of cards taken from the shared deck in one atomic operation and played through locally. Hands carried a per-consumer size derived from the surface's interval, a reservation protocol, a distinction between a card being reserved and being played, and a reaper to reclaim cards from a display that went away mid-hand.

**All of it is gone, replaced by one global queue.** The queue is the reservation. Two displays get different pictures because serving *removes* the entry, not because they were dealt disjoint sets in advance — and that is a much better reason, because it cannot drift, cannot leak, and has no bookkeeping to reconcile.

```sql
CREATE TABLE consumer (
  id         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  kind       TEXT NOT NULL,      -- 'wallpaper' | 'screensaver' | 'widget' | 'app' | 'cli'
  display_id TEXT,               -- stable display identifier, NULL for non-display consumers
  seen_at    INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- heartbeat
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

A registry and a heartbeat. That is the whole of it.

**What the hand design was actually buying, and where each of those went:**

- *It bounded cross-process write contention* — one reservation every sixteen minutes rather than a write every ten seconds. The queue does better: a consumer asking for a picture is one indexed `DELETE`, and producing one happens on the agent's own schedule rather than on the consumer's.
- *It gave the prefetcher a concrete work list* — the union of unplayed cards across outstanding hands. Its successor is the queue's fetcher, since 2026-09-05: dealing a card and fetching its bytes are separate operations again, and the queue itself is the work list, so nothing needs to be predicted.
- *It eased the screensaver's write access*, which was the original motivation: a saver reaching the canonical database every ten seconds is a hard thing to ask of code inside someone else's sandbox. This is the one that still matters, and it is now the Phase 6 spike's problem rather than something the deck design pre-solves. A saver that can serve from the queue is in the same position as any other consumer; one that cannot still needs the journal fallback.

**Displays still want stable identity**, and `CGDisplayCreateUUIDFromDisplayID` is still the right key — not for resuming a private rotation, which no longer exists, but so a monitor is one consumer across sleeps and cable swaps rather than accumulating rows.

## Consequences of one shared queue

Every surface draws from the same queue, so no photo appears on two of them at once and the repeat window applies across all of them together.

**Atomicity lives in the queue pop, not in the deal.** This moved, and it is worth being precise about because the guarantee is unchanged while the mechanism is not. Selecting a candidate and marking it shown are now two statements rather than one fused `UPDATE … RETURNING`, so two producers *can* briefly pick the same picture. Nothing breaks, because appending to the queue ignores a photo already queued and serving removes the entry under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. So a race costs nothing: the loser's append is refused.

**Corrected 2026-09-12.** Selection claimed the photo in the same `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` for a while — see the done list under *Known shortcomings* — and no longer does. Choosing a candidate is read-only, the queue refuses a photograph it already holds, and the claim belongs to the queue's fetcher, where it stops two lanes downloading the same bytes and expires so a fetch that dies sidelines nothing. The duplicated showing was never possible.

**A fast consumer no longer sets the pace for the cache.** Under hands, the screensaver's ten-second tick determined how deep the prefetch window had to be, and the cache cap had a hard floor at the sum of all hand sizes. Now dealing fills the queue to `queueSize` from the database, which is instant; bytes arrive at whatever rate the providers manage; and consumers drain it at whatever rate they ask. A screensaver that outruns the fetcher meets cold cards, waits two seconds for the head, drops what is still cold, and gets *fewer photos* — a `204` — which is the correct degradation and needs no capacity planning to arrive at.

It remains true that a long screensaver session can roll the entire library over, and that the wallpaper therefore sees a near-random sample rather than a slow walk. That is correct behaviour for a shared sequence, and worth knowing before it looks like a bug.

## Cache design

Two kinds of entry:

- **Referenced.** A file on the internal boot volume. The database stores its path; no bytes are copied. It does not count against the byte ceiling and eviction is a no-op.
- **Materialized.** Everything else, copied into the cache root — `~/Library/Caches/com.sydpolk.photosgoround[.debug|.claude]`, the build's own. These are what the ceiling governs.

**The dividing line is whether the bytes can go away, not which provider found them.** A Photos asset or a Google item is obviously materialized — there is no file to point at. But a plain file gets the same treatment whenever it lives somewhere that can disappear:

| Where the file lives | Treatment | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internal boot volume | Referenced | Always mounted. Copying is pure waste |
| External / removable / ejectable | Materialized | Drives get unplugged |
| Network volume | Materialized | Shares disconnect |
| iCloud Drive or another file provider | Materialized | The local copy can be evicted by the system without notice |

Determined at scan time from `URLResourceValues` — `volumeIsInternal`, `volumeIsRemovable`, `volumeIsEjectable`, and `volumeIsLocal`, memoised per volume and recorded per photo, since a single source could in principle span a mount point — plus `isUbiquitousItem`, asked once of the source's root rather than per file, for the memory reason in *Scanning is constant-memory*.

Two consequences worth stating. First, external-volume photos now consume cache budget, so a 40,000-photo drive is bounded by the ceiling like any other materialized source: unplugging it leaves the cached window playable, not the whole drive. That is honest and should be visible — "1,200 of 40,000 cached." Second, a same-volume file that the user deletes is genuinely gone, immediately, which is the intended contract rather than a shortcoming.

**Not `clonefile(2)`.** APFS cloning is same-volume only, so it cannot help the cross-volume case, which is the only case where we copy. On the same volume it would work and cost almost no storage — but a clone is an independent inode sharing extents, so deleting the original frees nothing while our clone lives. We would silently retain photos the user deliberately deleted, along with their disk space, in direct contradiction of "gone from the source means gone from the deck." It also requires APFS, so a reference path would be needed anyway.

### Cache layout

Nobody looks at the cache, so it is not designed to be *read* — but since Phase 1.5 it is designed to be *reconstructed*, because the index lives in the service's memory rather than in the database and is rebuilt from the filesystem at every launch. Meaningful filenames, date fanout, and preserved original names would still be effort spent on an audience of nobody; what the path has to carry is identity and nothing else — it carried a resolution as well, from Phase 1.5.3 until 2026-09-06.

```
cache/
  <source-uuid>/.original/<photo-uuid>.heic
```

Two levels of structure, each earning its place mechanically:

Source id at the top, photo id below. `pgr_ctl cache clear --source 3` becomes one directory removal instead of a thousand unlinks, and per-source byte totals become a directory size instead of a query plus a stat loop. That is the whole justification; if those two operations did not exist, flat would be correct.

The cache directory is marked `isExcludedFromBackup`. Letting Time Machine copy tens of gigabytes of photos that are already in the Photos library or already in iCloud wastes the user's backup volume on data we can reconstruct.

### Decode on demand, in the service

The service decodes; clients receive pixels. Scaling happens at decode time rather than by shrinking a full-size image. **The results were cached alongside the originals they came from until 2026-09-06 and are now discarded** — see *The resize cache is removed*; the section that argued for keeping them, *The cache becomes (photo, resolution), bounded by bytes*, is superseded and kept for its reasoning.

`CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` with `kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize` does not decode fully and then shrink — it decodes at a subsampled scale, so peak memory is bounded by the *output* size rather than by the source's pixel count. A 48-megapixel HEIC rendered for a 6K display costs about what a 6K image costs. Handing the result to a layer is all the display side needs.

**One resize at a time, off the shared pool, and never more than `resizeBudget`. Since 2026-09-16.** Resizing ran on Swift's shared thread pool, and on 2026-09-16 six resizes at once held it while the system's HEIC decoder was slow — single resizes took up to 741 s and requests that had nothing to do with resizing could not start. A probe on Syd's originals found nothing needs the main thread and HEIC stops getting faster past two at once. Every resize now runs on one serial `Resizer` actor with its own dispatch queue; a request waits at most `ServiceTiming.resizeBudget` and then streams the original, and a resize still queued when its request gives up is skipped. Syd, choosing between moving resizing into every client and keeping it here: "the agent will continue to do the resizing; the clients don't need to mess with this complication." `Agent Performance Overhaul.md`, *The resize probe* and *When the resizer stalls*.

**The budget is 1.5 s, and it is a measured number. Revised 2026-09-19, from one second.** The original was set from healthy resizes at 0.10–0.24 s, and it was cutting one render in nine. Measuring it properly needed the budget opened to ten seconds for a night, because a budget that cuts work censors the data you would set it from — the renders that *finished* had a p99 of 997 ms against a 1,000 ms budget, which was the wall and not the distribution. Over 3,573 renders with almost nothing cut: median 357 ms, p90 927 ms, **p95 1,406 ms**, worst 26,683 ms. Syd's rule: "we should set the limit to the p95 of our measurements" — one picture in twenty served as its original, which is the case the budget was always for. It is machine-specific and he accepted that: "on slower machines it might not be enough. Oh, well." A slower Mac serves more originals rather than showing nothing. `Agent Performance Overhaul.md`, *The budget was measuring its own wall*.

An earlier draft of this plan justified stored derivatives by claiming a large decode would stutter the screensaver. That does not survive the queue: the next several pictures are known and already resident, so a decode happens on a background thread with enormous lead time. Even RAW, the slow case, has orders of magnitude more slack than it needs.

**This document argued at length against caching the results, and that argument was wrong at one end of its range.** It ran: in a shuffle deck each photo is displayed once and not again for at least a window's worth of deals, so a cached rendering serves about one read before the deck moves on — a one-to-one write-to-read ratio, which is write amplification rather than a cache. That is a claim about *large* libraries stated as though it were universal. It is a function of pool size: a photo recurs after roughly `pool` deals, so at four thousand photos a rendering is indeed dead before its second read, and at a hundred photos it is re-read every seventeen minutes at a ten-second dwell. The small end is exactly where a person notices, because a small library is one where everything comes round often. Renderings were therefore cached, bounded by bytes and evicted as peers of the originals.

**And that was wrong at the other end of its range, which took a year to see. Reversed 2026-09-06.** The whole argument turns on a rendering being *re-read*, and it costed re-reads by pool size while assuming the key was a photograph. The key is `(photo, display box)`, and the box is a client's window in pixels — so it is not stable, it drifts. Two windows two pixels apart are two different keys holding the same picture twice, and every resize starts a fresh set. Measured on the development cache: 3,137 renderings in 0.99 GB, of which 882 MB was one source rendered at `1800x1066` and again at `1802x1068`. The re-read the argument was built on was not happening at either end. See *The resize cache is removed*.

**A rendering can outlive the original it came from, and serving honours it while warming does not.** Eviction takes originals and renderings as peers, and letting the original go first is deliberate — a rendering is a fraction of the bytes, and a client asking again at a size already held should not need the original back. Serving honours it: the requested box is named up front, and a photograph whose original has gone is still served from a rendering held at exactly that size. Since *Deal over everything* a card is queued with no bytes at all, so the old obstacle — three rules keeping an original present for anything queued — went with the rules themselves. What remains is look-ahead, which asks for the bytes of any card whose *original* is not held, because it cannot know what size the next client will ask at — so an original is re-fetched even when the rendering that will actually be served is already on disk. That is the cost of leaving it: a re-download to produce a size already held. ~~**Not decided.**~~

**Decided 2026-09-06, by deleting the thing it was about.** Nothing outlives an original any more, because nothing is held but originals; `serve` stopped taking a box, and eviction stopped ranging over anything but photographs. The open cost recorded above — a re-download to produce a size already held — cannot arise.

What the design meant to keep is a small **in-memory** decoded-image cache — the card being displayed and the next one or two, held as ready `CGImage`s. That is where the latency actually needs to be zero, it costs no disk, and it evicts itself when the process dies. **Not built as of 2026-09-12**: `Shuffle` asks for one picture at a time and decodes it when it arrives, with the previous picture still up meanwhile.

**Two exceptions used to be carved out here, and Phase 1.5 absorbs both rather than keeping them.** *Widget extensions* needed the server to write a small file sized to the widget family, because an extension runs under a roughly 30 MB ceiling that an arbitrary HEIC decode cannot be trusted to stay below. *The Watch and tvOS* needed a small file that is not derived from a local original but is the only copy that ever arrives. Sizing for every client makes both of those the ordinary path: nobody resamples but the service — a client still decodes the HEIC or JPEG it is handed, already at the size it asked for. Three mechanisms became one.

**One measurement would close the remaining doubt,** and it belongs in Phase 2 as a `pgr_ctl` subcommand: subsampled decode time to display size for the worst files in a real library — a large ProRAW, a 48-megapixel HEIC, a stitched panorama — on this machine. If those land in the tens of milliseconds, as expected, the case for on-disk derivatives disappears entirely. If a panorama exceeds the GPU's maximum texture dimension, that is a separate problem needing tiling rather than a derivative file.

**Taken 2026-09-06, and it did close the doubt — in the direction the prediction did not.** Renders came in at 109 ms median rather than tens of milliseconds, so the guess was an order of magnitude low. The derivative tier went anyway, because the argument for it turned out to rest on a different assumption that measurement also broke: that a rendering gets re-read. Keyed on the client's exact box it almost never does. See *The resize cache is removed*.

### Filling: there is no prefetcher

**Reversed 2026-09-05; see *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*.** **Superseded 2026-08-26 by *Deck and Queue v2.md*.** **Superseded a third time, and this time the heading is true again.** There is no prefetcher: nothing reads ahead of the queue and nothing warms it, because a card is only dealt once its bytes are already here. The cache stocks itself on its own draw.

**Superseded twice.** By *Deal over everything, and try at the moment of need* on 2026-08-23, and then by look-ahead on 2026-08-24 — so the heading is now false as well as historical: there *is* a prefetcher, it just prefetches something else. The one described below fetched bytes before anything was queued; the one that exists reads cards already queued and asks for theirs. See *What running it found*.

**Superseded 2026-08-23 by *Deal over everything, and try at the moment of need*.** Everything below describes producing as it was when it *was* fetching — the per-source pump, its lanes, its exhausted-for-the-round rule, and an overshoot bounded by `sources × concurrency`. None of it exists now: dealing writes a row and fetches nothing, and bytes arrive because serving asked for them. Kept because the reasoning about re-asking rates is what the new shape inherited, and because the mistake it records is one worth not making twice.

There used to be one — chunks of ten, an elevated first burst, then background chunks walking a work list until the cap. All of it is gone, and what replaced it is one sentence: **producing a picture and fetching its bytes are the same operation.**

A source asked for a picture picks a candidate, fetches it, and appends it to the queue. Nothing is queued before it is ready, so there is no work list to walk, no chunk boundary to resume from, and no window of "reserved but not yet available" for anything to reason about.

What the chunking was buying, and where each part went:

- *Bounded peak memory* — now bounded by per-source concurrency, which is four by default. Four in-flight fetches, not ten.
- *Checkpoints to re-read configuration and notice a disabled source* — every request is its own checkpoint, because every request re-reads the source.
- *A clean stopping point for an iOS `BGProcessingTask`* — a task that runs out of time simply stops asking. Whatever arrived is queued and ready; nothing is half-done.
- *Not issuing fifty thousand concurrent requests* — the concurrency limit does this directly, rather than as a side effect of batch size.

**The cold-start burst is what the queue does anyway.** An empty queue is below nominal, so every source is asked immediately and keeps being asked until it fills. The first pictures arrive in whatever order the providers manage, and the first request from a client is answered *no photos available* until one lands. There is no separate warm-up path to write.

**Asking again is driven by answers, not by the clock**, and getting this wrong was worth the lesson. The first version fired one round of requests per source on each tick of the maintenance loop and then waited for the next tick — which meant the queue filled at *concurrency per source per interval*, observed live as four pictures every five seconds against a folder of eight thousand. A thousand-entry queue would have taken twenty minutes to fill from a local disk that can do it in three seconds. The rate of a pipeline is set by how fast you re-ask, not by how fast each answer arrives.

So each answer re-asks its own source, and the tick is only what gets it started. Filling then runs at whatever the providers can sustain, bounded by per-source concurrency and by nothing else.

**Overshoot is bounded and expected.** The queue's size is a target rather than a ceiling, and the requests already in flight when it crosses that target still land. The bound is *sources × concurrency* — eight for two folders at the default of four — so a nominal thousand settles somewhere under 1008. This is not the earlier "1000 plus one per provider": that was right when a provider had a single request outstanding, and asking for four concurrent fetches each is what widened it.

**When the library is smaller than the queue, a clock takes over.** A pool of two hundred photos against a thousand-entry target can never fill it, and "ask again on every answer" is exactly the wrong rule there — the queue already holds everything there is, every request comes back empty, and the agent spins a core forever discovering that. So when the dealable pool is smaller than the queue's target, the pump stops chasing its own answers and reverts to one round of asks per tick. Small libraries are the normal case for a folder of wallpapers, not an edge case.

**Adding a source is still two phases**, and that part was always right: enumerate identifiers and insert rows first — seconds even for a large album, batched about five hundred rows to a transaction — and only then start fetching bytes. Rows are cheap and complete; bytes are expensive and windowed. *Since 2026-09-16 the insert is in pages of 100, each read before the lock and written only if it adds or changes something — `Agent Performance Overhaul.md`, Phase 4.*

### Deal over everything, and try at the moment of need

**Reversed 2026-09-05; see *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*.** **Superseded 2026-08-26 by *Deck and Queue v2.md*.** **The inversion below is reversed.** Dealing from every photograph and finding out by trying is what v2 replaces: the deck now deals only what can be shown this second, and the cache fills itself independently. Everything from here to *Costs Claude raised* describes the shape that was, including its six fixes — kept because each one records a real failure, and because the reasoning is what v2 inherited.

**Built 2026-08-23, and run against the real library overnight.** Syd's design, stated below in his terms. Claude's objections are in *Costs Claude raised* at the end, kept separate so they cannot be mistaken for part of it. What the first night of running it changed is in *What running it found*, below — the design held; six things around it did not.

Shuffle all the photographs we know about, whether or not their sources are available. Count on trying to get a photo to take care of serving from the cache, or filling the cache and serving, or skipping to the next.

Rather than keeping a count of a combination of what is cached and what is mounted. That way, when the server comes back up or goes down, the queue just works.

#### On fetch

**Reversed with its parent section, 2026-09-05**; kept for the record. Serving now waits for the head card's bytes rather than skipping, and the queue's fetcher replaced the queue of pictures to cache.

1. See if the pic in the queue is in the cache, and if it is, serve it.
2. Otherwise, fire off a separate process to cache the picture if possible, but the queue moves on and tries until it finds one.
3. If it cycles the entire queue, return no picture. It will populate soon enough. Returning "no photo" for taking too long is also fine — though cycling a cold library should not take very long, since each step is a cache lookup rather than a fetch.
4. When the caching for a pic is finished, add it back to the queue. **Reversed the same evening, and reinstated the next morning** — the round trip is worth reading, because the argument against it was correct and the conclusion was still wrong. See *Why a fetched picture rejoins the queue after all*.

#### The queue of pictures to cache

**Gone, 2026-09-05**: the queue's fetcher fetches the cards on the queue itself, head first, and there is no second queue. Kept for the record.

Another queue: pictures to cache. If it gets a request of something that is now in the cache, skip it and move on.

That is also what stops two requests fetching the same photograph twice — the check happens when the entry is taken off this queue, so asking for the same picture more than once costs a skip rather than a second fetch.

#### Asking for a fetch is not free, and the walk is where the flood would come from

**Reversed with its parent section, 2026-09-05**: a walk no longer asks for fetches, and `lookAheadDepth` and the backlog cap described here are gone. Kept for the reasoning.

**Every card a walk skips becomes a fetch request.** For a folder that costs nothing — the bytes are on the disk already, or they are a file copy. For Photos it is a `PHImageManager` request apiece, and for Google Photos an API call and a download against somebody's quota. So one request against a cold queue asks for as many fetches as the queue is deep.

The queue of pictures to cache absorbs it rather than passing it on: it drops a request for something already waiting, and however many are asked for it only ever runs `downloadConcurrency` of them at once. What it does not do is *decline* — everything asked for is eventually fetched.

Two consequences, both settled deliberately.

- ~~**`queueSize` bounds the flood as well as the walk.**~~ **No longer true, 2026-08-24.** It was, when a walk asked for a fetch per card it skipped and the queue's depth was therefore the bound on both. Three things now do that job separately and better: `lookAheadDepth` decides how many cards one request may ask about, `CacheQueue.maximumWaiting` decides how long the backlog may get, and dealing is paced to pictures served rather than to cards consumed. `queueSize` is left deciding only how finely the queue samples the library — see *The caps, and the arithmetic that will break them*.
- **The queue is never emptied to remix it**, which was proposed after a source added to a full queue took hours to appear. Emptying is cheap in cards and expensive in requests: the next walk would meet a queue of entirely uncached photographs and ask for one fetch per card, which against a metered provider is exactly the wrong thing to do for a cosmetic gain. A new or returning source mixes in at serving rate instead.

**Before the Photos and Google providers ship**, this wants one more lever: a cap on how many misses a single walk will ask for, separate from how deep the queue is. Nothing needs it while every source is a folder.

**Built 2026-08-24, and needed sooner than that.** Two caps, and they bound different things. `PhotoCache.lookAheadDepth` (20) is how many cards one request may ask about; `CacheQueue.maximumWaiting` (50) is how long the backlog of pictures to fetch may get, past which a request is turned away rather than remembered. The second is what stops a night of running from queueing the entire library: serving asks for the cards ahead of the one it showed *every time it shows one*, so an unbounded backlog accumulates until it names every photograph there is. A refused request is not blacklisted — the next look-ahead that reaches that card asks again.

#### Why a fetched picture rejoins the queue after all

**Reversed 2026-08-24 after a night of running.** The section below is the case for taking it out, left standing because the reasoning in it is sound and is still what governs *where* a card goes back. What it got wrong was an assumption it never stated: that a photograph left out of the queue would come round again soon enough.

It does not. Dealing draws uniformly from the whole library, so a photograph whose bytes were just paid for has a one-in-the-library-size chance of being the next card. **Every fetch improves the next draw by one part in fourteen thousand**, which means a cache built this way never catches up — the cards actually dealt are almost all cold, whatever is in the cache. Overnight, with two sources of 5,899 photographs on a network volume: 123 pictures shown from them in the 00h hour, 18 in the 01h hour, and **zero** from 02h through 06h, while a source needing no fetch served 327–341 an hour. Not a slowdown; a stop.

Capping the fetch backlog at fifty did nothing, and could not have: it bounds how much work is queued, not the odds that a dealt card's bytes are local.

**The drift the original argument feared is real, and is handled at the other end.** Dealing is now tied to pictures actually *served* rather than to cards consumed — see *Dealing is paced by serving* — so a card returning from a fetch is the same card that left rather than an extra one, and the deck advances only as fast as photographs reach a screen. That removes the mechanism by which fetch-completion order could come to govern the queue.

#### Dealing is paced by serving

**Reversed 2026-09-05; see *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*.** **Superseded 2026-08-26 by *Deck and Queue v2.md*.** **The rule survives and the mechanism does not.** One picture served still buys one card dealt — and now also one download. What is gone is the gauge that counted cards out for fetching as the queue's, and the empty-queue exception written into it, because a card never leaves the queue to be fetched.

A walk consumes every card it skips as well as the one it shows. Dealing to replace all of them means a skipped photograph is swapped for a fresh cold one *while its bytes are still being fetched*, so the fetch lands on a card nobody is holding a place for. One picture served, one card dealt — that is the whole rule, and it makes the queue's population stable and gives a returning card somewhere to return to.

The heartbeat that used to fill to nominal now only **seeds an empty queue**. Filling a merely short one would put the churn straight back. The seed exists because deal-on-serve deadlocks a cold start: with nothing dealt, nothing can be served; with nothing served, nothing is dealt.

**Dealing exactly one card per picture was the first attempt and it was wrong.** One per picture can hold a depth but never raise one, so raising `queueSize` left the queue stuck at its old size indefinitely — while lowering it worked, because draining needs no dealing at all. Found by setting the preference to 20 and watching the live queue sit at 10 with a `DEAL:` line after every serve. What keeps the distinction now is the gauge rather than a fixed count: **a card out being fetched still counts as the queue's**, so topping up to the target deals exactly the card that was served in the steady state, and deals more only when the target has genuinely moved.

**Reading a console, a burst of deals is not a batch size.** It is what the previous request consumed — one picture shown plus every card it skipped past.

#### The queue is not a queue

**Reversed 2026-09-05; placement is random again, by rank — migration 10, see *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*.** **Superseded 2026-08-26 by *Deck and Queue v2.md*.** **It is a queue again.** `sort_key` and its respacing were deleted in migration 8. Random placement existed because a completed fetch rejoined the queue out of deck order; a fetch completing now puts nothing on the deck, so there is one arrival and one end.

`position` was an autoincrementing key, so every card landed at the tail and the thing was a strict FIFO. Both arrivals want otherwise, and they want opposite ends:

- A card **returned after its fetch** is warm and ready. At the tail it waits a whole traversal — its bytes paid for and then left sitting.
- A card **freshly dealt** from a new source is invisible for the same span, so a folder added now cannot appear until the queue has turned over once.

Putting either at the head is worse, and was tried: the order pictures appear in becomes the order they were *fetched* in, and the fastest source owns the front whatever its share of the library.

So placement is random, and `sort_key` (migration 6) is what makes it cheap — a card gets a key drawn uniformly between the smallest and largest currently queued, which is a uniform position among the cards present without moving any of them. No gap-finding, no shifting, no explicit-position inserts; that machinery existed for the head-and-tail experiments and does not come back. A card lands strictly inside the existing span, so it can never become the very next picture — at best second.

**The keys have to be respaced, and that is not a nicety.** A new key is drawn between the lowest and highest currently queued, so the highest never rises while the lowest rises with every card served — the interval only ever shrinks. Modelled over a queue of twenty it reaches *exactly zero* in about a thousand cycles, which at ten seconds a picture is under three hours; a live queue was measured at a span of 0.009 after eight. Once keys tie, ordering falls back to `position` and the queue is silently a FIFO again, with random placement gone and nothing announcing it. `PhotoQueue.respaceIfCollapsing` renumbers to `1…n` whenever the span drops below one — one `UPDATE` over a queue's worth of rows, roughly once an hour. **The silent reversion is the reason it exists**, not the arithmetic.

**Measured, on the same library and the same source.** First photograph from a newly added network folder, from the moment its card was dealt to the moment it was displayed:

| | deal → display |
| --- | --- |
| FIFO, queue 50 | 8m 38s |
| random, queue 50 | 4m 46s and 5m 17s |

The decomposition is the part worth keeping. Under FIFO the card spent **5m 17s** travelling from the tail to the look-ahead window, **1 second** being fetched, and 3m 20s waiting its turn. Under random placement it was asked for **11 seconds** after being dealt, because it landed inside the window rather than having to reach it. **99.8% of the latency was queue traversal**; the network was never the bottleneck.

#### The queue-size sweep

**A measurement of the design reversed on 2026-09-05**: it was run with look-ahead in force, which no longer exists, and `queueSize` is twenty for the reasons in *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*. Kept for the numbers.

Run 2026-08-24 against the live agent without restarting it, on a library of 9,002 photographs: 8,287 referenced on the boot volume and 714 materialized on an SMB share. Each size set as a preference, the queue left to drain to it one card per picture served, then nine minutes sampled — about 57 pictures.

| queue | pictures | skips | src 9 shown | median deal→display | median lead |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 50 (FIFO) | — | — | 1 | 8m 38s | 5m 17s |
| 50 | — | — | 2 | 4m 46s | 11s |
| 30 | 57 | **0** | 1 | 0m 52s | 10s |
| 20 | 57 | **0** | 4 | 1m 13s | 10s |
| 10 | 57 | **0** | 1 | 1m 13s | 11s |

**The result is that the number decides nothing about correctness.** Not one card at any size arrived at the head without its bytes, and the *lead* — deal to `asked for` — is ten seconds at every depth, meaning random placement drops a card inside the look-ahead window within a picture of it being dealt. The reinsertion path built the same morning stayed idle throughout.

**The latency column is too thin to rank the sizes and should not be read as though it ranks them.** One, four, and one sample; and because placement is random the latency is inherently uniform from near-zero to `depth × dwell`, so single samples carry almost no information. The 5m 15s outlier at queue 20 exceeds that depth's own maximum traversal, which makes it an artifact of the convergence window rather than a measurement.

**What the sweep does settle is the mix.** At queue 10 the sampled queue held **no** source 9 cards at all — expected, since a source with 7.9% of the library has an expected holding of 0.79 at that depth. At 20 it held three.

So the choice is between sampling the library faithfully at every instant and turning over quickly, and **20** is where those meet: it equals `lookAheadDepth`, so every card is inside the window from the moment it is dealt, which makes arriving without bytes structurally impossible rather than merely unobserved.

**None of this survives a slow provider**, and it is worth being explicit that the sweep measured one storage medium. Every number above rests on a one-second fetch. See *The caps, and the arithmetic that will break them*.

#### Later: tuning the queue by measurement rather than by hand

**Not built.** The sweep above is a thing a person ran for forty minutes, and it is exactly the shape of thing the agent could run for itself — every input it needs is already logged. A pass every couple of days, binary-searching the depth against the library as it currently stands, would keep the number right as sources are added and removed rather than fixing it at whatever suited the library on the day it was chosen.

What makes it tractable is that the objective is not the latency, which is noisy and needs many samples, but the **skip count**, which is binary, counted across every card rather than one source's, and available from the log without instrumenting anything. Search downward while skips stay at zero; stop one step above where they start. The mix constraint is arithmetic rather than measurement — the depth at which the smallest source's expected holding drops below one is `1 ÷ its share` — so it needs no experiment at all.

The reason to want it is not tidiness. It is that the right answer moves: adding a Photos or Google Photos source changes the fetch time by an order of magnitude, and the value that was comfortably right becomes the value that skips every network photograph. A number chosen once is a number that will be wrong later without anything announcing it.

#### Counting what actually reached a client

`times_shown` counts a photograph being *chosen* — incremented inside `Deck.markShown` when serving picks a card, before anything is rendered, because the shuffle key and the repeat window are re-rolled in the same statement. A file that will not decode raises it and shows nobody anything.

`times_delivered` (migration 5) counts bytes leaving the process with a 200 on them. **Where the two disagree is exactly the set of photographs the deck believes it is showing and the user has never seen**, and nothing else in the system can report that. Not backfilled, because a copy of `times_shown` would assert something untrue about every row that ever failed to render.

#### The caps, and the arithmetic that will break them

**Reversed 2026-09-05; see *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*.** **Superseded 2026-08-26 by *Deck and Queue v2.md*.** `lookAheadDepth` and `maximumWaiting` no longer exist, so neither does the arithmetic. What bounds fetching now is the credit rule — twice the deck's size at launch, one per card drawn — and what bounds a hostile provider is `FetchDeadline` plus `SourceBench`.

`lookAheadDepth` (20) is the lead-time knob, not `queueSize`: the warning a cold photograph gets is `lookAheadDepth × dwell`. `queueSize` need only be at least that for the window to cover the queue; beyond it, extra depth buys a finer-grained source mix and nothing else.

The constraint that decides whether a photograph is ever skipped:

```
drain = maximumWaiting ÷ downloadConcurrency × fetchTime
lead  = lookAheadDepth × dwell
```

Against an SMB share today: 50 ÷ 4 × 1s = **12.5s** of drain against **200s** of lead, which is why nothing is ever skipped and the reinsertion path is idle. Against a provider where a fetch takes thirty seconds — which Photos and Google Photos will be — 50 ÷ 4 × 30s = **375s** against the same 200s, and it inverts: cards arrive at the head before their bytes, every time.

Three ways out and they are not equivalent. Raising `downloadConcurrency` is free against your own disk and rude against somebody's quota. Raising `lookAheadDepth` and `queueSize` together buys warning at the cost of staleness. Lowering `maximumWaiting` is the one that scales, because it is the only one that costs nobody anything — which argues for it being derived from the other three rather than being a constant.

#### The case for leaving it out, which was right about where and wrong about whether

Raised and settled 2026-08-23, after two wrong answers about *where* to put it.

**The queue should be distributed proportionally across the sources, whatever their mount status.** Dealing already does that: one shuffled order over every photograph gives each source a share of the queue matching its share of the library, and it does so knowing nothing about what is mounted. Unreachable photographs are skipped when they come up, which changes what is *shown* without changing what is *queued*.

**The re-insertion is the only thing that perturbs it.** Step 4 puts a photograph back when its bytes arrive, so the queue is continuously topped up in the order fetches *complete* — a local folder finishes quickly, a network share slowly, and the mix drifts toward whichever is fastest rather than whichever is larger. Random placement spreads that drift around the queue; it does not remove it.

So step 4 is gone. The queue's composition is purely the deck's, and caching is a pure side effect — bytes appear, and nothing about what is queued changes. **What it costs**: a photograph just paid for is not shown soon; it waits until the deck deals it again. The bytes stay cached, so when it does come up it serves at once. The fetch is not wasted, only unrewarded for a while.

**Two wrong answers preceded it**, both about *where* to put it rather than whether to. At the **tail** it sat behind everything the walk already knew it could not show — and the walk stops after one cycle, so the one card known to be servable was reliably just past the bound. That was "stuck on the same picture for minutes". At the **head**, the order pictures appeared in became the order they were *fetched* in, so a local folder filled the front and a network share never got a look in. That was "not seeing enough mixing of the sources", and it was caused by fixing the first. A random position spread the second fault around without removing it; removing the step removes both.

`PhotoQueue.insertRandomly` and the position machinery it needed — gap-finding, spacing, explicit-position inserts — existed only for this and were deleted. **Random placement came back on 2026-08-24 and none of that machinery did**, which is the part worth noticing: a `sort_key` column places a card among the others without moving any of them, so the whole apparatus was a consequence of insisting that `position` be both the identity and the order.

#### What this replaces

- **Per-source candidate selection.** One shuffled order over every photograph, so `Deck.poolSize(forSource:)` and the per-source repeat window go.
- **Producing as fetching.** Today nothing is queued until its bytes are local. Here the queue holds cards and the bytes are fetched when something tries to show one — so the per-source pump, its lanes, and its exhausted-for-the-round rule go with it.
- **Restricting an unavailable source to what is cached.** `PhotoStore.heldOriginals(ofSource:)` and the `usable` filter on candidate selection were built this evening and are exactly the combination-keeping this removes.
- **`Source.available` as a gate.** It stays as something the panel reports; nothing about dealing consults it.

#### Why, from what went wrong

Two of the three faults found on 2026-08-23 were artifacts of the shape above rather than mistakes inside it.

- The repeat window was measured against the whole library while candidates were chosen per source, so twenty photographs beside five thousand got a window of two hundred and sixty, could never satisfy it, and reshuffled on every deal.
- Production chose a photograph before knowing it could fetch it. For an unreachable source holding thirty of five thousand it chose blind, failed, and wrote the source off for the round — so the thirty that could have been shown were passed over roughly ninety-nine times in a hundred.

Both were fixed in place, and both fixes were then deleted by this: `Deck.poolSize(forSource:)`, the per-source repeat window, `PhotoStore.heldOriginals(ofSource:)`, and the `usable` filter on candidate selection are all gone.

#### What running it found

**History of the design reversed on 2026-09-05**: look-ahead and the walk budget recorded here are gone with it; the local-first first pass remains. Kept for the measurements.

Six changes, 2026-08-23 into 2026-08-24, all found by watching a real library rather than by reading the code. Each is recorded with the measurement that motivated it, because the numbers are the part that would not be guessed the same way twice.

**The launch purge, which was the big one.** `indexCache` walked the queue at startup and dropped every materialized card whose bytes were not local. That was right under the old shape, where a card only reached the queue once its bytes were there — under this one it deletes precisely the cards that would warm the cache, and leaves the referenced cards that never needed bytes. Two sources of 5,899 photographs on a network volume had, across a week, been shown **zero** times and held 33 cached originals; every restart emptied them out of the deck. Removing it made the queue proportional to the library within one refill. `PhotoQueue.remove(photoID:)` had no callers left and went with it.

**Serving asked the source before it asked the cache.** Measured per card: the cache check is 0.012 ms — an in-memory index and a stat on the local SSD — and `provider.existence` against `/Volumes/home` is 843 ms warm, 3348 ms cold. The expensive one ran first, so a walk paid a second per card to confirm photographs it was about to skip anyway. Reversing it makes a skip free and leaves exactly one network round trip per request, for the card actually going out. **The deleted-photo guarantee is unchanged** — it is a promise about what is *displayed*, so it belongs to the card being displayed and to no other.

**A time budget on the walk.** One cycle of the queue was the only bound, so a cold 250-card queue on a network volume produced requests of 45 s, 67 s, and 125 s. `PhotoCache.walkBudget` is two seconds, checked before taking each card so a card is never popped and abandoned, with the first card exempt so a slow moment never becomes a blank screen. After the reordering above it should essentially never fire; if `out of time` appears in a log now, something pathological is happening.

**Look-ahead, which was the counterintuitive one.** Warming happened only as a side effect of stepping *past* an uncached card, so how much warming a request did was however far it happened to travel before finding something servable. Add back a source whose photographs are always servable — anything referenced — and the walk stops on the first card and warms nothing. Measured live: cache requests fell from ~130 per five minutes to **19** the moment such a source returned. A healthy source was starving the sick ones. So serving now reads the next `lookAheadDepth` cards without consuming them and asks for the bytes of any it does not hold. Cards keep their places and their turn; a fetch that has not finished when a card's turn comes is skipped exactly as before.

**Refreshing asked the provider about every photograph it held.** No diff and no set of what was seen, one round trip per row — which is a stat on a folder and most of a second on a network volume, so a source of 5,093 photographs took **eighty-five minutes**, and because the agent awaits its refresh, the main loop stopped for the duration: preferences unread, doorbells unanswered, a newly added source never scanned. The walk already knows what is there, so departures are now the difference. What the enumeration produces goes into a `walk_seen` temp table and anything the pool holds that is not in it is gone — one `NOT EXISTS`, paged. **This does not break "never build a collection of a whole source"**: the rule is about the heap, and what goes here is one short string per photograph in a table SQLite spills to disk. Same source, after: **1.1 seconds**.

**`QueueFiller` still had the shape of the model it replaced** — a `sources:` list, a `concurrency:`, a task group with lanes per source, and a `Tally` of which source had gone quiet — while the agent called it with one fake source and one lane, because dealing picks from one shuffle and writes a row. 150 lines to 94. Two assertions got stronger rather than being deleted: filling now lands on *exactly* nominal, where lanes in flight used to overshoot by up to the concurrency.

**A note on burst sizes**, since the log reads oddly at first: a fill deals until the queue is back at nominal, so a burst of nineteen `DEAL:` lines means the previous request consumed nineteen cards — one shown plus every card it skipped past. It is not a batch size.

#### Costs Claude raised

Recorded as objections to answer, not as part of the design.

- ~~**The promise being spent.**~~ Accepted. The queue existed so that `GET /v1/next` never held a socket open through a download; firing the fetch into the background and moving on keeps the request fast by a different route. What it gives up is that the photograph the deck chose may not be the one shown, and that a cold library answers "no photo" until the first fetch lands — both fine.
- ~~**A cold library walks the whole queue.**~~ Answered: it returns no picture, and populates soon enough.
- ~~**Two requests must not fetch the same photograph twice.**~~ Answered by the queue of pictures to cache: an entry already in the cache when it comes off that queue is skipped. The deck's claim is not needed for this.
- ~~**How many fetches may be in flight.**~~ Answered by the same queue — whatever drains it is the bound. The number of workers is a number to pick, not a mechanism to design.
- ~~**What happens to a card whose fetch fails.**~~ Confirmed: a skipped card leaves the queue and comes back on success. A fetch that fails leaves it out, and it comes round again in the ordinary shuffle rather than accumulating as a queue of things that cannot be shown.

### Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards

**Decided 2026-09-05, reversing v2's population. Built 2026-09-05, all five steps, and run on the real library the same day — see *What running the reversal found*.** Syd's design, stated in his terms. Claude's costs are in *Costs Claude raised* at the end, kept separate so they cannot be mistaken for part of it.

**The core idea: the cards served converge to a proportional distribution across the sources after a short amount of time.** Everything below is in service of that sentence. From the user's side: adding a new source is exciting, and results should start appearing after seconds or a few minutes, rather than hours or days.

The deal draws uniformly from **every available photograph** — its source enabled and the photograph not retired — whether or not its bytes are here, and whether or not its source is reachable. **Reachability is not part of the predicate at all.** A photograph is served out of the cache regardless of reachability, so the whole thing still works with no network at all, provided it has run for any period of time before; a card whose source is away and whose bytes are not held fails its fetch and is dropped, which is the ordinary failure path. The card goes on the queue regardless, **placed at random among the cards present** — anywhere from second to last, never at the head. The queue then fetches the bytes of every card it holds that lacks them: **all of it**, not a window ahead of the head, and **nothing beyond it** — the twenty cards are the prefill, and when a card is served another fills in and is fetched. Serving **waits** for the head card's fetch to land. If something goes wrong with the fetch, the card is dropped and serving moves on to the next card in the deck: the card was dealt, but no bytes were served; such is life, and next time it is dealt maybe the bytes will be there. There is no credit counter; at a queue of twenty, the depth bounds fetching on its own.

**Amended 2026-09-07: an unavailable source deals only what is held**, so reachability is in the predicate after all, for unheld photographs. Once a failed fetch stopped deleting them, an unreachable source's unheld photographs cost a card a pass for nothing; they wait outside the pool, rows and history untouched, until the source is back, and the deal joins `source` to know. See `Missing Albums Plan.md`, Phase 2. **The same day the serve wait became two seconds, spent once** — see *Serving waits, once* below.

#### What prompted it

Measured on the live agent, 2026-09-05, ten minutes after forty-one Photos albums were added beside a referenced folder, an iCloud Drive folder, and one iCloud file:

| | rows | servable under v2 | share of the library | share of the v2 pool |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Coins folder (referenced) | 456 | 456 | 22% | 63% |
| Album Covers folder (iCloud Drive) | 436 | 162 | 21% | 22% |
| One file (iCloud Drive) | 1 | 1 | | |
| Photos collections, 41 albums | 1194 | 104 | 57% | 14% |
| | 2087 | 722 | | |

The queue held three Photos cards of twenty and the last fifteen deals held three, which is the 14% exactly. v2 was doing what it says. What it says is not what Syd expects: **the photographs in the database are what the random deal should draw from**, and a source added to a running agent should be represented in proportion to its share of the library after one deck's worth of deals, not after the cache has caught up.

Under v2 the catching up is paced to viewing. A refresher round starts only at launch and when a card is drawn, and a drawn card banks exactly one credit, so one Photos original landed every 10.5 seconds — the fetch timestamps and the serve timestamps were the same six values. With 1090 Photos originals un-held, convergence to library proportions was about three hours of continuous viewing away, and every one of those hours the screen would have been mostly coins. The 10 GB ceiling was not the bound; the cache held 1.88 GB. The credit rule was.

#### What it changes, against what is built

- **The deck's population.** `Deck.servableStorage` leaves the pool, the candidate predicate, `dealablePopulation`, and the unused count. The repeat window is a fraction of the whole available library again — about 1044 cards at 0.5 on today's 2087 rather than 361 on 722. `cached_at` stays a column; it stops being a gate — except, since 2026-09-07, for an unavailable source.
- **Reachability stays out of the deal.** *Deal over everything, and try at the moment of need* recorded that "`Source.available` stays as something the panel reports; nothing about dealing consults it," and that stands. Considered and declined on 2026-09-05 in two steps — first as a gate, then as a gate with a door for held photographs — and neither is needed: an unreachable source's held photographs serve from the cache, and its unheld ones fail their fetch and are dropped like any other failed card. Besides, tracking reachability in the database is doomed to fail — there is no way to refresh it in real time so that it is accurate, and we only know a picture is reachable when we try to get it. The predicate is `source_enabled` and `media_type`, with no join. **Revised 2026-09-07; see the amendment above** — `available` is in the predicate for unheld photographs, and the deal joins `source`.
- **The refresher's own draw goes.** `Deck.nextRemoteCandidate`, `unheldRemoteCount`, `CacheRefresher.begin`, `cardDrawn`, `bank`, and the credit arithmetic have no job left. What replaces them is one rule: **fetch what is queued and not held**, head first, `downloadConcurrency` at a time, each fetch against `FetchDeadline` and each source under `SourceBench`. Filling the queue is what starts fetching, so a burst of twenty deals on a cold queue is a burst of up to twenty fetches, four in flight.
- **Serving waits, once.** A request that finds the head card's bytes missing asks for the fetcher — a kick, absorbed if a round is already on it — and waits for one of three things: the bytes land and the card is served; the card leaves the queue because its fetch failed, and the request moves to the new head; or the wait runs out. A card whose source is benched is dropped without waiting, because nothing is fetching it and nothing will for at least a minute.
- **The client's wait is bounded at sixty seconds, as a user preference, and when it runs out the card is dropped.** `serveWaitSeconds`, default 60, zero never waits. The request then takes the first queued card whose bytes are here without waiting again; the cards it passes over are still being fetched and keep their places. **Revised 2026-09-07: two seconds, and no walking past.** The wait is spent once per request on the head, and every cold card after it is dropped on sight rather than left in place — cards left in place settled at the head, and every request paid for them again. Two seconds is measured: of the cold head cards that landed on 2026-09-07, 76% did so within two seconds of reaching the head. See `Preferences.serveWait`. **Dropping rather than keeping the card at the head was decided while building step three**: a card still cold a minute into its turn is almost always from a benched source, and keeping it would make every following request wait the same minute on the same card until the bench lifted. Dropping has the nice property of doing much less work when there is an active consumer — a dead card costs one wait, once, and the queue turns over past it.
- **A failed fetch drops its card in the fetcher, not in serving.** The plan's first draft put the drop under serving; it lives where the failure is known, so a bad card leaves at once rather than sitting at the head until its turn, and serving's wait ends because the card is gone.
- **Placement is random again, by rank.** Added after the first run, which was better but showed a new source's first card waiting a whole traversal at the tail — about three and a half minutes. A new card takes a uniform slot from second to last and the ranks at and behind it shift up one: migration 10 adds `rank INTEGER`, backfilled from `position` so a live queue keeps its order. Never at the head, so the card about to be shown is never displaced and every new card has at least one picture of fetch lead. A shorter queue was the other way to the same feeling and was declined, out of concern that it would have problems serving in a hostile environment. The cost is fetch lead — a card placed second has one picture's worth rather than a traversal's — and the wait above is what pays it when it comes due.
- **The Photos fetch deadline comes down from 900 seconds to 60, matching files.** `CacheSettings.libraryFetchLimit` was set to fifteen minutes on 2026-08-26 from a measurement of a Photos original stalling for a fixed 300 seconds — taken, it turned out later, on a day when everything touching iCloud on the machine was wedged. One deadline for every kind; a stall is a stall.
- **The claim keeps its owner.** `claimed_at` still means *a fetch is running for this photograph*, taken by the queue's fetcher and released when the fetch ends, and it still stops two lanes downloading the same bytes. Dealing takes no claim, as now.

#### What stays

The deck algorithm — pass, window, random offset, `shuffle_key` — is untouched; only its population moves. A fetch completing puts nothing on the queue: the card it fetched for is already there and keeps its place. (The queue was to stay a FIFO; that lasted one run — see *Placement is random again* above.) Eviction stays least-recently-viewed and nothing is exempt from it but the last photograph held, so a queued card's original can be evicted before its turn; the fetcher then fetches it again, which is the same rule as a card that was never held. `FetchDeadline`, `BlockingWork`, and `SourceBench` stay exactly as they are — they answer a hostile provider, and this change does not make providers less hostile. *One photograph, one row* stays. The launch bridge stays deleted.

#### What this reverses in this document, and in *Deck and Queue v2.md*

Each passage this undoes now carries a one-line *Reversed 2026-09-05* pointer back here: the deck algorithm's pool sentence, *The repeat window*, *Filling: there is no prefetcher*, *Deal over everything, and try at the moment of need*, *Dealing is paced by serving*, *The caps, and the arithmetic that will break them*, and *Cold start*. *The queue is not a queue* carries a second pointer, since placement is random again. *Eviction* and *Surviving a source that will not answer* keep their v2 notes, because v2's answers there stand.

*Deck and Queue v2.md* is left as written. Its Phases 3, 4, and 5 — the servable-only pool, serving that does no fetching, and the filler that counts nothing — are what this section reverses, and so is its decision that the deck stays a FIFO; its Phases 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 stand, with Phase 2's refresher replaced by the queue's fetcher described above.

#### Build order

Small slices, each run against the live library before the next begins, and the second is the one that proves the shape.

1. **Population. Done.** The residency predicate left the deck. Reachability went in, then in with a door for held photographs, then out again, all within the hour — see *Reachability stays out of the deal*. Eight tests that pinned v2's pool were flipped with dated comments; `deck stats` says "dealable" and counts held separately.
2. **The queue fetches its own cards. Done.** `QueueFetcher` replaced `CacheRefresher`: head first, four lanes, kicked after every fill and once at launch, a kick mid-round remembered and the queue walked once more before the round ends. The claim moved with it. A failed or timed-out fetch drops its card. The Photos deadline came down to sixty seconds. Net about eight hundred lines fewer.
3. **Serving waits. Done.** `serveWaitSeconds`, the poll for bytes-or-gone, the drop on timeout, ~~the first-warm-card fallback~~ (removed 2026-09-07), the benched-source shortcut, and the pop moved after the checks so two consumers are still settled by one `DELETE`. A file-backed suite covers the wait with a fetch landing on a second connection mid-wait.
4. **Delete what is dead. Done.** The queue's head-pop and `PhotoCache.residentPhotoUUIDs` had no production caller and went; fourteen test call sites now peek and remove as serving does. Kept on purpose: `Deck.unheldRemoteCount` for `deck stats`, the two equal fetch-deadline constants as the named seam, and the `cacheUnnecessary` event. About fifty compiler warnings in test files predate this work and were left.
5. **The ledger. Done.** Both man pages, the `deck stats` and `cache status` wording, a test for the new preference's default and clamp, and this section. The Mac panel shows only per-source counts and needed nothing.

#### What running the reversal found

**First run, steps one to five, on the live library.** Better at once: `DEAL:` lines in library proportion, each materialized one followed within seconds by `CACHE: fetching` and `CACHE: … original cached`, and no `waiting` lines in the ordinary case. What it showed was the tail. A new source's first card was dealt promptly and then waited a whole traversal behind nineteen others, which reads as nothing having happened for three and a half minutes. Syd asked whether new cards went on the end or used the random value to land somewhere in the deck; they went on the end. Random placement came back that afternoon, by rank rather than by key, with the queue's depth left alone — see *Placement is random again*.

**Second run, with placement.** Syd's verdict: *that's really nice. This is basically what I have wanted all along this journey.* A source added to a running agent is on the screen within a picture or two, in proportion to its share of the library, and stays so.

**Two things placed differently from the plan's first draft**, both recorded above: the drop on a failed fetch lives in the fetcher, and a wait that runs out drops the card rather than keeping it at the head.

#### Costs Claude raised

Recorded as objections to answer, not as part of the design.

- ~~**A request now waits on a download.**~~ Answered 2026-09-05: the client waits sixty seconds, configurable, then takes the next card whose bytes are here while the fetch continues — **revised 2026-09-07 to two seconds, with the cold cards after it dropped rather than passed over**; and the Photos deadline drops to sixty so no single card can hold the head for a quarter of an hour. v1 measured 45, 67, and 125-second requests before the walk budget; the bound here is the same idea, placed on the request rather than on the walk.
- **Always have something to show, and a wait is a blank.** A cold queue on a slow provider shows nothing until the first fetch lands, where v2 showed whatever was on disk. Head-first fetching and the referenced folder's cards, which need no fetch, are what soften it; nothing else does.
- ~~**A slow source slows the whole screen.**~~ Answered in the building: a dead card costs one wait, once, and is dropped; a card whose source is already benched is dropped without waiting at all. `SourceBench` still bounds how many timeouts a share can cost before it is left alone.
- **The v1 starvation does not come back, and it is worth saying why.** v1 starved because a fetched card left the queue and had a one-in-fourteen-thousand chance of being dealt again. Here the card stays and is waited for, so every fetch is rewarded with a showing. The mechanism that caused the overnight stop is absent by construction rather than bounded.
- **Random placement halves the average fetch lead.** A card placed second has one picture's worth of time for its bytes rather than a traversal's, so the wait above will occasionally come due right after a burst of deals from a slow source. Accepted for the immediacy; if `waiting` lines become common after adding a source, the deadline and the wait are the two numbers to look at, not the depth.
- ~~**Reachable needs a definition the deal can read.**~~ Answered 2026-09-05: it needs none, because reachability is not part of the predicate. The fetch finds out. **Until 2026-09-07**, when the scan's `available` went into the predicate for unheld photographs; see the amendment above.

### Eviction

**When it runs, decided and built 2026-09-16: after every file written to the cache, and at no other time.** Syd: "since you are keeping track of the cache in the database, you should evict when you know the total size is too big, and not any other time", then "ditch the timer", and "So, after you write any file to the cache, run evict()." The files are an original a fetch brings in and a resized copy kept, from `/v1/next` or the dashboard's thumbnail. Until then eviction ran on the agent's maintenance heartbeat, every `maintenanceIntervalSeconds`; the heartbeat and the preference are gone. Between a write and its eviction the cache is over its ceiling, and Syd accepted that: "you might temporarily exceed the space, but that's fine". The free-space floors are checked at the same moments, so a disk filled by something else is noticed at the agent's next write. Two writes finishing together do not evict side by side: the second is skipped, and the next write catches up. `pgr_ctl cache evict` runs the same pass and takes nothing when everything fits. `TODO.md`, item 10 of *Passed over on 2026-09-16*.

**Revised again 2026-09-16: oldest file first, originals and resized copies together, by when the file was made.** The resize cache came back and shares `cacheByteCeiling`, and Syd: "oldest file first, whether or not is an original", then, asked whether an original shown a minute ago should count as new, "when the file was made." So the rank below — `MAX(last_shown_at, cached_at, added_at)` — is replaced by an original's `cached_at` against a copy's `created_at`, in one order. The last original is still never evicted; copies carry no such protection. The FIFO-by-creation policy struck through at the end of this section is, in effect, back. `Agent Performance Overhaul.md`, Phase 2b.

**Superseded 2026-08-26 by *Deck and Queue v2.md*, and revised again 2026-09-06.** Eviction is strictly least-recently-*used*, over photographs rather than `(photo, resolution)` entries, and nothing is exempt but the last photograph held: eviction stops at one entry rather than empty the cache, so a single file larger than the whole budget is kept rather than a blank frame shown. The FIFO-by-write-time policy below, and the queued-photograph protection that went with it, are both gone.

The rank is `MAX(last_shown_at, cached_at, added_at)`, each term coalesced to zero first. **It was `COALESCE(last_shown_at, cached_at, added_at)` until 2026-09-06, and that is a different query** — `COALESCE` takes the first non-null, so once a photograph had ever been shown, the moment it landed in the cache was never consulted again. A card dealt for a photograph last displayed ten hours ago was fetched, landed with `cached_at` of *now*, and still sorted at rank 1; it was evicted on the next maintenance tick, before it was ever shown, and the card then reached the head of the queue with no bytes and downloaded it a second time. On a live agent the front of the order was thirteen cards, every one on the queue and every one cached seconds earlier, while what survived was photographs shown half an hour before that the repeat window guarantees will not be wanted for hours.

**It was invisible for as long as the ceiling was 10 GB**, because eviction almost never ran. Dropping the ceiling to 1 GB made it run every tick, and every tick takes from the front. Worth keeping as a pattern rather than as a bug: the prose in this section was right the whole time — the rank is "when anybody last had a reason to keep it", and there are three ways to have had one — and the SQL said something else. Nothing checked the two against each other until the numbers got loud.

~~FIFO by creation time, bounded by bytes, ranging over `(photo, resolution)` entries rather than over photos — so a photo can outlive its own original while a rendering of it survives, which is a feature rather than a defect. See *Entries compete individually*.~~ The policy that stood until 2026-08-26; both of its halves are gone.

~~The reason plain FIFO is correct here rather than something cleverer is that pictures are fetched in the order the deck offers them, so the order they enter the cache is roughly the order they will be shown.~~ **That argument died on 2026-08-24 and the policy outlived it.** Both halves stopped being true: bytes arrive from the queue of pictures to cache in the order fetches *complete*, and cards are placed at random positions rather than at the back, so nothing connects write order to display order. The cache is no longer a sliding window over the deck.

**Superseded 2026-09-06, and kept for the reasoning**: there is no FIFO left, `createdAt` was removed, and the ceiling is 1 GB, so eviction runs every tick. What justified keeping FIFO was weaker and worth stating as such: **it does not matter much yet.** A shuffle shows every photograph about equally often, so there is no hot set for an LRU to protect — and `createdAt` is never updated on a hit, so this is FIFO by *write* time rather than by use in any case. Where it would start to matter is a library whose working set exceeds the ceiling, so photographs are evicted before their turn comes round. That needs a library several times the size of any tested here, and it is the point at which this wants measuring rather than reasoning about. **Nothing measured then had evicted anything at all** — 166 MB against a 50 GB ceiling.

Two guards on top of it:

- ~~**Never evict a picture that is in the queue.**~~ Gone with the `protecting:` set, which made the ceiling unreachable whenever everything cached was also queued. What replaces it is the rank being right: a queued card was just fetched, so `cached_at` is recent, so it sorts last anyway. That is a weaker guarantee than an exemption and it is the correct one — the ceiling stays reachable.
- **The byte ceiling is the primary control.** A thousand photos is somewhere between 2 GB and 100 GB depending on whether they are phone JPEGs or ProRAW, so a count never bounded the thing that mattered. It began life as a safety valve behind a count cap. Two free-space floors sit beside it: below `cacheCriticalFreeBytes`, 2 GB, eviction aims at half the ceiling, and below `cacheMinimumFreeBytes`, 5 GB, nothing more is fetched.
- ~~**An original is never evicted while a render pending on it needs it.**~~ There are no longer two kinds of entry to coordinate.

### Choosing the shipping default

**Cancelled 2026-09-06; see *The resize cache is removed*.** The sweep below presupposed a cache that predicts what will be wanted soon, where a larger budget buys a better hit rate and the experiment finds the knee. The cache is a staging area for the queue, so the budget follows the queue — twice its working set — and there is no knee to find. The default is 1 GB. What is kept here is the last bullet, which is a quality bar rather than a cost curve and is worth watching whatever sets the number.

The default byte ceiling is explicitly a starting point to be replaced by measurement. The experiment belongs in Phase 2, as a shell loop against real sources, and it should record, for budgets of roughly 5 / 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 GB:

- wall-clock time to fill the cache from cold, for a local folder and for an iCloud-optimized Photos album;
- how many photos a given byte budget actually holds, for a representative library rather than a synthetic one;
- steady-state agent memory and CPU while filling;
- how often a deal misses the cache during a long screensaver session, which is the number that actually matters — a cap is big enough when the fast consumer never outruns it.

The last measurement is the one that decides it. Everything else is a cost curve; that one is the quality bar.

### The iOS variant

The same policy with a different filling schedule. **The smaller numbers are gone: since 2026-09-06 there is one `CacheSettings.default` for every platform**, and the `phone` preset — a 2 GB ceiling — went with the Mac's drop to 1 GB, which had made the phone's the larger of the two. A ceiling that follows the queue does not vary by device, because the queue does not; a device that genuinely needs a different number is told one through the preference. The queue is the same length on a phone too — `queueSize` has one default, twenty, everywhere. Filling would happen in the foreground and in `BGProcessingTask` windows when charging — and because dealing is a database write and each fetch lands whole or not at all, a task that runs out of time simply stops. Nothing is ever half-done, so there is no boundary to resume from.

## Cold start

**Reversed 2026-09-05; see *Deal over everything, and the queue fetches its own cards*.** **Superseded 2026-08-26 by *Deck and Queue v2.md*.** The cold start is answered structurally rather than bridged: at launch the heartbeat seeds the queue before it refreshes anything, dealing needs no bytes, and the fetcher is kicked at once, so *nothing dealt, nothing served, nothing dealt* cannot close. The launch bridge earlier versions described does not exist.

**Warm start** — queue populated, pool present. Serving a picture is one indexed read and one delete. Sub-millisecond. Every launch after the first should be this.

**Cold start** — nothing in the pool, nothing queued, nothing cached. The agent enumerates each source's identifiers first (fast: a directory walk is I/O-bound but cheap, and `PHAsset.fetchAssets` is lazy) and inserts all rows, so the *pool* is complete within seconds even though no bytes have moved. Then the heartbeat deals the queue full, the queue's fetcher fetches its cards head first, and pictures become servable as those fetches land.

**Until the first one lands, a client asking gets "no photos available".** That is an ordinary answer rather than an error state, and every surface has a defined empty state for it already — the screensaver bounces its label, the wallpaper leaves the desktop alone, a widget shows a static one. There is no separate warm-up path, no readiness signal to design, and no "not ready yet" flag for anything to check: an empty queue answers the question by itself.

## Photos is optional, and there is exactly one of it

Two constraints on the Apple Photos provider, both narrowing.

**The system is complete without Photos.** Someone who does not want their Photos library involved — or does not use Photos at all — gets a fully functional product from folders and individually selected files. That is not a degraded mode with features missing; it is the configuration Phases 1 through 3 are built and tested on before the provider exists.

The practical consequence is that authorization is requested lazily. `PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization` is called when a Photos source is *added*, never at launch and never speculatively. A user who never adds one never sees the prompt, and the app never appears in that list in System Settings. If authorization is denied or later revoked, Photos sources go unavailable and everything else carries on — denial is a state to display, not an error to handle.

**There is one library, and it is the system one.** PhotoKit talks to whichever library Photos has designated as the System Photo Library. There is no public API to open an arbitrary `.photoslibrary` bundle, so multiple libraries are not supported — not as a deferred feature, but as a stated non-goal. A user with several libraries sees the system one; switching which is which is done in Photos, by them, and is not something we offer or track.

**Switching libraries is the failure mode to handle.** `PHAsset` local identifiers are library-scoped, so every stored identifier from library A fails to resolve against library B. The whole Photos source goes dark at once.

That must not be read as "the user deleted forty thousand photos." It is the same shape as an unmounted external drive, and it gets the same rule, generalized:

> **A source that loses *everything* at once has become unavailable; it has not had its contents deleted.**

So the scanner has a threshold: if a scan finds a source's entire population missing, it marks the *source* unavailable and leaves the photo rows and their deal history intact, rather than processing tens of thousands of individual disappearances. Reconnecting the drive, or switching the system library back, restores everything with its shuffle position intact. This one rule covers unmounted volumes, revoked Photos authorization, and library switches, which is a good sign it is the right rule.

What we owe the user is a clear explanation rather than cleverness: the source is shown as unavailable, with the reason, and adding the new library as a fresh source is a deliberate act they take if that is what they meant.

### What happens to a source that never comes back

**A source that cannot be reached and a source that is confirmed gone are different states**, and this section used to describe only the first. Both are covered below, and the difference decides whether anything is deleted.

**Offline: nothing happens, and that is the design.** Unavailability is a state rather than an event, so a source that is merely unreachable needs no special handling — it decays on its own.

**A photo keeps being shown if its bytes are local, regardless of its source's state.** Because materialization is keyed to volume, this mostly resolves in the user's favour. An unplugged external drive, a disconnected share, a switched Photos library — all of those sources were materialized, so their cached photos keep being served from what we hold. Nothing blanks.

The exception is a same-volume file that is genuinely deleted. Those were referenced, so they *are* their bytes and they leave rotation at once. That is the correct behavior: deleting a photo should remove it, not start a countdown.

Then eviction does the rest. As other photos are shown and fetched, the orphaned ones age toward the front of the eviction order and go in the ordinary way. They shuffle out gradually rather than vanishing at once, and when the last cached copy goes, the photo simply stops being dealable. No reaping pass, no special case, no code that exists only for this — the cache's normal behavior is the garbage collector.

The one thing to get right is that an orphan must not be re-fetched. A source that is unavailable is not asked to produce, so it never tries and never logs a storm of failures. **That sentence stopped being true on 2026-09-05**, when the deck began dealing every enabled photograph reachable or not, and it was the storm it describes — a rebuilt Photos library, two albums renumbered, every uncached photograph dealt, fetched, and failed — that brought it back on 2026-09-07, for the unheld half only: an unavailable source deals what is held and nothing else. See `Missing Albums Plan.md`.

**Gone: the rows and the bytes go together.** A folder deleted while its volume sat right there is not coming back, and neither are its photographs. Holding a row nothing can produce and bytes nothing will ask for helps nobody, so each photograph leaves the pool *and* the cache as it is reached. The source itself stays — it is in preferences, which is the durable list, and it repopulates if the folder ever returns.

Removing a source is the same rule stated deliberately rather than discovered: the row goes, its photographs go by cascade, and **its cache directory is deleted in the same breath** rather than waiting for the next launch to notice nothing claims it. `pgr_ctl sources remove` prints what came back. See *Rows and bytes leave together*.

### The source list, audited

Read through on 2026-08-23 after a run of faults that all turned out to live in the same place. **It is the one piece of state that cannot be rebuilt from anything, so every fault here loses something a person chose.** Five were found; each was reproduced as a failing test before it was fixed.

- **An entry it could not read was destroyed by the next unrelated write.** Reading dropped whatever failed to parse and every mutation is read-modify-write, so one malformed entry — a hand-edited plist missing a locator — cost you that source permanently the next time anything was added. Reads now return the specs *and* the entries they could not parse, and writes carry the second half through untouched.
- **Re-adding a folder discarded the options asked for.** Already-listed meant *skip*, so asking for recursion on a folder already there was dropped on the floor and reported as "nothing new". It now applies them; `added` still reports only what was created.
- **A folder stored the old way stranded.** The locator is the identity and it is matched as a bare string, so an entry written before folders were normalised could not be removed by the spelling everything else used — removal silently failed and reconciling put the source straight back. Normalisation moved into `SourceSpec.init`, so every path agrees by construction. Normalising on *read* alone had made it worse: writes still produced the other spelling, and the same folder became two sources.
- **Forcing a re-read named the wrong domain.** `reload` synchronised `kCFPreferencesCurrentApplication` — this process's own domain, never the suite the values live in. The agent calls it once a tick precisely to pick up a `defaults write` from another process, and it had never done that. `Preferences` now remembers its suite and names it.
- **A concurrent writer's change vanished.** `UserDefaults` has no compare-and-swap and the whole array is rewritten on every change, so the agent and `pgr_ctl` could each read the same list and write over each other, and the loser's source simply never appeared. Every mutation now re-reads before writing and starts over if the list moved, up to five attempts. **This is the fourth of the five objections *Preferences as a client transport* raised, and the only one that was still live** — it is narrowed rather than eliminated, because nothing short of a lock file makes two processes safe here.

### Reconciling reads the list; it is never handed one

Found by deleting a source in the app and watching it come back — refreshed, rescanned, and serving pictures again.

**The table is rebuilt from whatever list it is given, so a caller holding a copy from a moment ago re-creates anything removed since.** The agent's loop is exactly that caller: it reads the durable list, walks its sources for as long as that takes — minutes, over a network share — and reconciles. A source deleted in between came back, with a *new* `uuid`, all its photographs, and its place in the queue.

So `reconcile` takes the preferences and reads the list itself. Nobody can hold a stale copy of something they are never handed. The list-taking form survives as an internal call for the tests that assert the projection rules against a list they wrote.

**It also broke the panel in a way that looked unrelated.** A resurrected source has a new identity, so the row the user had selected stopped existing; every control reads the selection, so `−` went dead while the row still looked chosen. One click, nothing happens, and no way to tell why. The panel now follows a selection by *locator* when the identity under it changes, and clears it only when the source is genuinely gone.

### Rows and bytes leave together

Settled after the source endpoints landed, and written up because it revises what *Phase 1.5.3* concluded about sweeps.

**Whenever a photograph's row is deleted, its cached bytes are deleted with it.** That covers every way a photograph leaves: the source removed, the folder deleted, recursion switched off, the file deleted from under us. The source store holds the byte index for exactly this reason, and every path that removes reports what it freed — so a caller that was handed no index reads zero rather than leaking silently.

**What this replaces was a report nobody read.** A refresh used to hand back a list of orphaned cache paths on the reasoning that the store did not know where the cache root was. Nothing ever consumed it. Every photograph that left a source therefore kept its bytes until the next launch rebuilt the index from the filesystem and discarded whatever the database no longer claimed — which is a long time to hold a large library's worth of bytes, and required a restart to collect.

**The launch rebuild stays, as the backstop it always was.** An index built *from* the disk cannot disagree with it, so a crash midway through a removal is still cleaned up at the next start. What changed is that it is no longer the only mechanism, or the fastest one.

**Removing by source rather than photograph by photograph**, because the cache is already laid out by source `uuid`: one directory, one removal, and no walk proportional to how many photographs were inside it.

### Clearing the cache on purpose

Automatic decay is not enough, because the reasons to want the space back are immediate: a source that is never coming back, a disk filling up, a library that was added by mistake, or simply wanting to start clean.

- **`pgr_ctl cache clear`**, with `--source <id>` to drop one source's bytes, `--unavailable` to drop everything belonging to sources that are gone, and no argument to empty it entirely.
- **A control in the settings UI**, showing bytes held per source with a way to reclaim them. **Not built, deliberately for now**: the Settings panel exists, and cache clearing stays in `pgr_ctl` with every other verb the app did not take on — see `MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md`.

**Two kinds of eviction, and only one of them costs anything.** Ordinary eviction — least recently wanted at the byte ceiling, and the disk-space guard — is incremental, continuous, and invisible: it discards the photos nobody has had a reason to keep for longest, and the queue's fetcher refetches whatever a queued card still needs. That is normal operation and needs no warning, no confirmation, and no user awareness at all.

An **explicit clear** is the other thing entirely. It evicts everything, and everything has to be fetched again. That is the whole point of it, and it is the reason it needs a guard rail that ordinary eviction does not. For folder sources the cost is nothing — referenced photos were never copied, so "re-retrieving" them is opening a file. For Photos and Google sources it can be enormous: a thousand materialized originals against an iCloud-optimized library is potentially tens of gigabytes and hours of downloading, on a connection that may be metered.

So the operation states its price before charging it. Both the command and the UI report, before confirming: how many photos will need re-downloading, how many are referenced and therefore free, and roughly how many bytes are implied. A full clear asks for confirmation; `--unavailable` does not need to, because photos whose source is gone can never be re-fetched anyway — that variant frees space at zero future cost, which makes it the one to reach for first.

**Shuffle state survives; only bytes are discarded.** Deal ordinals, shuffle keys, and last-shown times are untouched, so a cleared cache refills into the same rotation rather than reshuffling the library. Clearing is a storage operation, never a shuffle operation — and if even that turns out to be wrong, deleting the database rebuilds everything from the sources at the cost of a rescan.

**Recovery is the cold-start path, which already exists.** The queue is emptied along with the bytes. The heartbeat then deals it full again and the fetcher fetches the new cards, exactly as on a fresh install. Displays hold their currently decoded image — which is in memory, not in the cache — until the first new picture is ready, so clearing does not blank a screensaver mid-session.

**And a disk-space guard, which is a genuine gap otherwise.** A byte ceiling bounds our copy, not the volume, and the volume can fill for reasons that are not ours. The server therefore checks free space before each fetch: below `cacheMinimumFreeBytes`, 5 GB, it stops fetching and logs why; below `cacheCriticalFreeBytes`, 2 GB, eviction aims at half the ceiling until it recovers. Running out of disk should degrade into "the deck stops growing" rather than into a full volume, which on macOS is a genuinely bad day for everything else running.

### Showing unavailability

An unavailable source must look unavailable — this is exactly the state where silence gets read as a bug. But **the photo is never annotated.** No badge, no overlay, no warning drawn on top of an image, on any surface. A cached photo from a missing source displays perfectly and there is nothing wrong with it; defacing it to warn about a future problem would trade the one thing this product is for against a message that belongs somewhere else. Notification goes in the chrome, never on the picture.

- **A menu bar item on the agent that appears only when something needs attention** — the quieter channel the ambient surfaces need. A missing source, a revoked permission, a disk nearly full. Invisible when all is well, which is the well-worn Mac idiom and costs nothing the rest of the time. **Not built.**
- **`pgr_ctl sources list`** marks it inline, with the reason.
- **The settings UI** shows it in orange, with the reason in plain words — "drive not connected", "photo library changed", "permission revoked" — and the count of photos held in limbo. A source that has quietly stopped contributing to a shuffle is invisible otherwise, and the user's first clue would be a rotation that feels smaller than it should.

## Getting full-resolution originals out of Photos

This is the specific bug you are working around, so it deserves precision. There are two APIs:

- `PHImageManager.requestImageDataAndOrientation` with `PHImageRequestOptions.isNetworkAccessAllowed = true`, `deliveryMode = .highQualityFormat`, `version = .current`. This gives you the rendered current version including edits, as data.
- `PHAssetResourceManager.writeData(for:toFile:options:)` with `PHAssetResourceRequestOptions.isNetworkAccessAllowed = true`. This streams the original resource straight to a file without ever holding it in memory.

The critical flag in both cases is `isNetworkAccessAllowed`. When it is false — the default — and the library is set to "Optimize Mac Storage," Photos hands back whatever low-resolution derivative happens to be local. That is exactly the ugliness you described. Apple's own screensaver appears to make this mistake, or to deliberately avoid the download cost.

`PHAssetResourceManager` is the better choice for cached originals: it writes directly to disk, so a 100 MB ProRAW file never becomes a 100 MB `Data` in the agent's address space. The cost is that it gives you the *original*, not the edited render — a photo you cropped in Photos would come back uncropped. **Built that way**: the provider takes `.fullSizePhoto` when present — the edited render — and falls back to `.photo`, matched on exact kind so an edited Live Photo's paired movie is never taken. It fetches with `requestData` rather than `writeData`, because `requestData` returns a request id and so can be cancelled when a fetch is abandoned. See `SystemPhotoLibrary`.

Throughput matters because the first fill of a 1000-photo deck against an iCloud-optimized library could be tens of gigabytes. The agent should download at low QoS with a small concurrency limit, respect `NSProcessInfo.thermalState` and low-power mode, and pause entirely on a metered connection. **Only the concurrency limit is built** — four fetches across the whole queue; nothing reads the thermal state, low-power mode, or whether the connection is metered.

## Where the two directories go, and `--prod`

***Superseded 2026-09-24: there is one library per build, and no `--prod`.*** Syd: "They should be completely separate builds with completely separate assets." Each build's container, cache and preference domain share one name — `com.sydpolk.photosgoround`, `….debug`, `….claude` — and the development/production axis this section describes, with its `.dev` names and its flag, is gone from the agent, `pgr_ctl`, the app, the screensaver and the wallpaper. `Scripts/scrub-data.sh` — `scrub-dev.sh` until it was renamed and widened the same day — deletes what the retired `.dev` libraries left behind. `Storage`. The rest of this section is the history of how it got there.

The agent writes to exactly two places, and **development is the default** — *for Debug and Claude builds since 2026-09-24; a Release agent is production however it starts* (see below):

| | holds | default | with `--prod` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| storage root | `photogoround.sqlite` and its WAL sidecars | `<repo>/.build/pgr-container/` | `~/Library/Containers/com.sydpolk.photogoround/` |
| cache root | copied photo bytes | `<repo>/.build/pgr-cache/` | `~/Library/Caches/com.sydpolk.photogoround/` |
| preferences | the source list and every setting | `com.sydpolk.photogoround.dev` | `com.sydpolk.photogoround` |

**Safe by default, dangerous on purpose.** Running the binary with no arguments cannot touch a real library — it writes to a development container of its own. Reaching the real one takes `--prod`, typed deliberately. The inverse default would mean every casual run was one typo away from a library that took hours to fetch, and every test of a delete path was a live-fire exercise.

**Earlier on 2026-09-24 the build decided the deployment** — a Release agent production however it was started; Syd: "a release build should always install and use a release agent, period, no matter how it is launched" — and later that day the deployment went altogether, as above.

**Both deployments moved under the user's home directory on 2026-09-19**, and the storage name carries the build configuration: `~/Library/Containers/com.sydpolk.photogoround[.debug|.claude][.dev]`, with the cache and the preference domain named to match. Development wrote into `<repo>/.build` until then, which two users sharing a checkout would have shared, and which all three build configurations opened at once. Syd: "all of the datafiles have to run in the users home directory so that this will work for two different users on the same machine", and "as long as the three agent configs can all run at the same time without clobbering each other".

**`pgr_ctl` is the exception to the default.** It defaults to production, because it is the rig and is never shipped, and takes `--development` and `--release`/`--debug`/`--claude` to reach any of the six.

**Which deployment a build runs is decided by the build, since 2026-09-23: Release runs production, Debug and Claude development** — `Deployment.current`. Syd: "switch Release to production", ahead of the first Developer ID build. The app, its window's picture loop, the screensaver, the wallpaper extension and the agent's plist all follow it; a Release plist passes `--prod`, and a bare run of the agent is still development. Until then every surface asked for `.development` by name — and the wallpaper extension asked development and then production — so a Release build ran on development storage, and a Release extension read its interval from a development domain an older Release had left behind. The 2026-09-19 decision to give each build its own identity should have carried this with it, and did not; Syd: "this is an instance of you not following through to the logical conclusion of a policy or architecture decision." Of the six combinations `pgr_ctl` reaches, a build now uses three: Release production, Debug development, Claude development.

**All three switch together, and that is the whole point of the flag.** This was learned the hard way: pointing the storage root at scratch space moved the database and the cache and left *preferences* — and therefore the source list — pointing at the real ones, so a run that believed it was isolated would happily remove somebody's sources for good. Two of the three are obviously per-deployment and the third silently is not. One flag that moves all three is the only version of this that a person can hold in their head.

The individual overrides remain, for the cases that genuinely want them — a cache on another volume, a database somewhere odd, `PGR_PREFS_SUITE` for the preference domain — and each still wins over whatever `--prod` would have chosen. `status` prints which rung supplied the roots, so it is never a guess.

**Why the two are separate at all**, rather than the cache living inside the container: `~/Library/Caches` is a place the OS may purge whenever it likes, which is exactly right for bytes we can fetch again and exactly wrong for the database. Nesting the cache inside the container would put it somewhere the system will never reclaim, throwing away the one piece of cooperation macOS offers for free.

**`~/Library/Containers` was expected to arrive with the LaunchAgent**, since a container is what a bundle identifier gets you. The agent bundle exists and no container came with it — nothing is sandboxed — so `--prod` uses that path because `HostEnvironment` names it, not because a container put it there.

### Finding `.build` from Xcode — the mechanism, and why it went

**Removed 2026-09-19, when development storage moved under `~/Library`.** There is nothing to walk to any more, and `MacHostEnvironment.buildDirectory` is deleted. Kept here because the problem it solved is real and will be met again by anything that tries to find a checkout from a binary.

The development root was found by walking up from the executable looking for `.build`, which a SwiftPM binary carries in its own path — `<repo>/.build/<triple>/<config>/photogoroundd` — so `swift run`, the wrapper script and a bare invocation all agreed without being told anything.

**Xcode was the case that could not cover**, and it mattered because debugging the agent has to work without a scheme argument. Xcode builds into DerivedData, which is nowhere near the checkout, so the walk found nothing and the old fallback — the working directory — resolved to `/.build` and failed outright on a read-only volume.

The second rung was therefore the source tree the binary was compiled from: `#filePath`, a compile-time constant pointing into the checkout, walked up to `Package.swift`. **That rung is what made the mechanism untenable in the end**: it answers with where the *source* was, not where the agent is, so every Xcode-built agent from one checkout resolved to the same container — Syd's Debug build and an agent's Claude build opening one SQLite, with one write lock between them. Naming the storage after the build configuration and putting it under `~/Library` removed the question rather than answering it.

A shared scheme lives at `.swiftpm/xcode/xcshareddata/xcschemes/`, and still sets no arguments and no environment — the binary finding its own roots is a property worth keeping true rather than papering over in a scheme.

### Where an Xcode-launched *app* puts its container, which is not where you think

Ahead of Phase 3, and recorded because it is a genuine trap. A sandboxed Mac app launched by Xcode does **not** use `~/Library/Containers/<bundle-id>`. CoreDevice registers the Mac as a device in its own right and redirects the app's data container to:

```
~/Library/Developer/CoreDevice/DeviceFS/device-<UUID>/AppDataContainers/<bundle-id>/
```

Verified against another project on this machine: the live store sits there, while `~/Library/Containers/<bundle-id>/` holds only the container shell. That `device-<UUID>` is a CoreDevice identity, unrelated to `IOPlatformUUID`, and it is what makes "Download Container" work for a Mac app in Devices and Simulators.

None of this touches `photogoroundd`, which has no bundle identifier for CoreDevice to key on. It bites in Phase 3: once the Mac app is sandboxed and shares an App Group with the agent, an Xcode-launched app reads the CoreDevice container while an agent started from a terminal reads the real one, and two processes that are supposed to share one database are silently looking at two. The symptom — an empty window beside an agent insisting it holds eight thousand photos — points nowhere near the cause. **Moot as built**: the app is not sandboxed, has no App Group, and opens no container — it asks the agent over HTTP — so this is recorded for a sandboxed build that may never come.

## Documentation lives in the repo as man pages

Every command gets a `Documentation/<command>.md` written as a man page —
`NAME`, `SYNOPSIS`, `DESCRIPTION`, `OPTIONS`, `ENVIRONMENT`, `FILES`, `EXIT STATUS`,
`SEE ALSO`. `Documentation/photogoroundd.md` was the first; `Documentation/pgr_ctl.md` followed in Phase 2.

Markdown rather than roff because these are read in a browser and a diff far more
often than through `man`, and because a format nobody can write is a format that
goes stale. The man-page *structure* is the part that matters: it forces every
option, every environment variable, and every file to be listed somewhere, which is
exactly the material that otherwise only exists in a `usage()` string and in
somebody's memory.

They are not a substitute for PLAN.md and do not explain why anything is the way it
is — that is this document's job. A man page says what the command does; the plan
says why it does it that way. Converting to roff later, if `man photogoroundd` ever
matters, is a mechanical step.

## The service is the interface

Phase 1.5, and a reversal of something this document asserted throughout. It is written up as a reversal rather than quietly amended, because the reasoning changed rather than the facts, and because the two readings of the old text were far apart enough to be worth recording.

**What the old text said.** *The service does one thing* claimed that "the database is the transport, so anything that wants to inspect or change the library opens it directly and never needs the agent's cooperation at all." *What a client asks for, and what it gets back* laid out a four-step exchange whose first three steps are a service protocol — the client asks, the service selects and fetches and checks, the service answers *ready* or *nothing available* — and whose fourth step is "the client reads the card and loads the image." That one clause is where a display reaches into the database and the cache, and it is the entire difference between the two readings.

**What changed.** The generalization was doing double duty. For `pgr_ctl` inspecting or configuring the library, *the database is the transport* is obviously right and stays right. For a screensaver getting a picture it is a completely different claim, and the sentence did not distinguish them. The arbitration was never in dispute: one shared queue, serving as the atomic step, no photo on two surfaces at once — precisely because there are multiple simultaneous clients. What moves is the wire.

**So: clients ask the service for a picture and get bytes back. They never open the database and never open the cache.** The service is the only process that touches either.

### Why HTTP, and why that is not a preference

XPC does not leave the machine. The moment a Watch or an Apple TV is a client, XPC is off the table entirely, and of the four rungs the Phase 6 spike contemplated — direct container access, localhost HTTP, XPC, consumption journal — only HTTP spans devices. That settles it without appeal to taste.

It also makes the clients language-agnostic, which is a real gain and worth not over-reading: it frees the *clients*, not the service. The service remains irreducibly Apple, because it is the thing that touches PhotoKit, TCC, ImageIO, and `NSWorkspace`. Two rewrites were considered and rejected on that ground, both recorded under *Alternatives considered* below.

**HTTP is the Mac service's interface, not a universal one.** *The iOS family* rejects a local HTTP server on iOS for a reason that still holds — it is suspended along with the app the moment it backgrounds, so it would solve nothing while adding an entitlement and a security surface. iOS therefore stays service-and-client in one process, talking to itself through the same client type over an in-process transport. One implementation of *ask for a picture*, two transports underneath, and the retry policy written once rather than four times.

### The protocol

One endpoint matters. Everything else is inspection.

```
GET /v1/next?consumer=screensaver&display=<uuid>&w=3840&h=2160

**Corrected 2026-09-12.** There is no bearer token and no `401`: the listener binds loopback, which is the authorization — see *Every device serves itself*. The example now shows every header a `200` carries. `X-PGR-Name` and `X-PGR-Source-Name` are percent-encoded because a header is ASCII and a filename is not, and the name goes without its extension, since the format sent is the one `Accept` chose; see *Known shortcomings* item 8.

**`204` rather than an error**, because *no photos* is an ordinary reply. A fresh install answers that way until downloads land, and every surface has an empty state already.

**`X-PGR-Empty` says why, when the agent knows for certain. Added 2026-09-26.** A bare `204` is a queue turning over, a source still on its first scan, or an empty library, and a client cannot tell which — so it waits out three of them before it says anything. Two causes the agent can state outright: `no-sources`, when no source is enabled; and `no-photos`, when the deck's pool is empty and every source that is there has finished a scan. **An offline source counts for what the cache holds of it and nothing else** — Syd: "If there is an offline source, but there are photos in the cache from it, we use the cache", and "if everything is offline, and there is nothing in the cache, then display *No Photos Available*." The deck's pool already counts exactly that, so the rule is the pool's size plus the scans. `EmptyReason` in `PhotosGoRoundAgentAPI` names both; `PictureEndpoint.emptyReason` decides, and counts the pool only once every source has finished, so a large library still filling is not counted on every empty answer.

**Consumer identity is parameters, not registration.** The `consumer` table is a registry and a heartbeat, and a request is both — first sight creates the row, every sight updates `seen_at`. No register call, no session, nothing to reap.

**Format by content negotiation.** Every client here is Apple, so HEIC is the default and roughly halves the bytes; JPEG stays as the fallback anything can decode.

**Inspection was planned as its own set of routes, and was not built.** `GET /v1/status`, `/v1/deck`, `/v1/queue` and `POST /v1/refresh`, `/v1/cache/evict`, `/v1/cache/clear` do not exist; `pgr_ctl` answers those questions by opening the database, and never speaks HTTP. What the agent does serve beside `/v1/next`: the source routes under `/v1/sources` and `/v2/sources` (see *The database is private to the service*), `/v2/photos` for the Photos picker, and the dashboard (see *The agent's dashboard*). **Source configuration did come to the service after all**, by `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`, which write preferences on the client's behalf; *This is also the control channel* still works with the service stopped, through `pgr_ctl` and `defaults write`.

### The request does not wait, because the queue already did

An earlier version of this design had the client fire and forget, with the answer arriving later over Server-Sent Events carrying a download ID. It was rejected, and the reason it was rejected is the reason the synchronous shape is safe.

The worry was that `GET /v1/next` would hold a socket open through an iCloud download. It cannot, though the reason changed. A card has been dealt before its bytes exist since 2026-09-05, so a request can wait — but only for the head card, only once, and only for `serveWaitSeconds`, two seconds by default, after which every cold card is dropped. The work at request time is that bounded wait plus a subsampled decode and a re-encode — **109 ms at the median, measured 2026-09-06**, not the tens of milliseconds asserted here originally. An empty queue answers `204` without waiting.

Two further things killed the two-phase version. A WidgetKit extension does not run continuously and cannot hold an event stream open to hear an answer, so the surfaces with the tightest budgets were exactly the ones the callback could not serve. And holding a rendered file between the notification and the collection is a reservation with a lifetime and a reaper — the hand reservation this plan already deleted, reappearing under another name.

### The pop, and what it costs

**The endpoint servicing the download removes the queue entry, whether or not the download succeeds.** No reservation, no confirm, nothing with a lifetime, and the deck's atomicity stays exactly where *Consumers* put it — in the queue pop.

Three consequences follow, and all three are accepted rather than mitigated.

- **No `Range` requests and no resume.** "Download" usually implies both, but a resumed request cannot ask for the same card, because it is already out of the queue. A failed download is a lost picture; the client asks again and gets the next one.
- **A client that never finishes eats the deck quietly.** A watch on bad cellular that times out every attempt spends a card each time and shows nothing. Harmless at any plausible rate against a real library, and visible in `consumer.seen_at` against a `times_shown` that never moves — but it is the one way this rule is wrong without saying so.
- **Clients back off, voluntarily.** Three failed attempts, then wait, then try again. **Not built as written**: `Shuffle` waits a fixed interval instead — ten seconds between pictures, three after an empty answer, five when the agent is absent — with no strike count and no jitter. Only one failure mode actually spends a card, so the taxonomy matters: a refused connection costs nothing because the pop never ran; a `204` is not a failure at all and must not count toward three strikes, or a fresh install backs off exactly when it should keep asking; a stream that started and did not finish is the one the rule is for; and a timeout with nothing received is genuinely ambiguous, because the service may have popped and started writing into a socket nobody was reading.

The wait was meant to be **exponential with jitter** rather than fixed, for a reason specific to this design: a Mac going to sleep fails every client at once. Wallpaper, screensaver, two widgets and a watch hit their third strike within seconds of each other, and a fixed interval puts them back in lockstep for ever.

### Fit to the size the client is about to draw at

**The request carries the resolution and the service does the subsampled decode.** This is the change that pays for itself several times over.

*Decode on demand; do not store derivatives* already carved out an exception for widget extensions: "the server, which has no such ceiling, writes a small file sized to the widget family." Sizing for everyone **absorbs that exception rather than keeping it**, and it does the same for the Watch and tvOS case, where the small file is not derived from a local original but is the only copy that ever arrives. Three mechanisms become one.

It also means the phone stops needing to understand the watch. Under the old design the phone knew watch pixel dimensions and widget families and pre-rendered for them; now the watch asks for what it is about to draw and the phone answers like any other client, with `WCSession.transferFile` carrying the same exchange.

Right now, the image is shrunk to fit, keeping aspect ratio, and never enlarged. Eventually, there will be more options added to the endpoint to provide more flexibility.

**And it reopens the cache design rather than settling it**, which is the subject of the next section. Rendering on demand at an arbitrary requested resolution requires an original to render from, so originals stay — but the renderings turn out to be worth keeping too, for a reason *Decode on demand; do not store derivatives* did not account for.

### The cache becomes (photo, resolution), bounded by bytes

**Superseded 2026-09-06 by *The resize cache is removed*, and kept whole for its reasoning.** Everything below is what was built, ran for a fortnight, and was then taken out; the two claims it rests on — that the resolution space is small and stable, and that a rendering gets re-read on a small library — are both addressed there against measurements. The parts that survive it are the byte ceiling as the only bound and the UUID-keyed filesystem index, which are argued here and are still the design.

*Decode on demand; do not store derivatives* rejected a derivative tier on the grounds that "in a shuffle deck each photo is displayed once, then not again for at least a window's worth of deals… a cached derivative therefore serves about one read before the deck moves on. A cache with a one-to-one write-to-read ratio is not a cache; it is write amplification."

**That is a claim about large libraries, stated as though it were universal.** It is a function of pool size. A photo recurs after roughly `pool` deals, so at four thousand photos a rendering is evicted long before it is read twice — and at a hundred photos it is re-read every seventeen minutes at a ten-second dwell. The write-to-read ratio is 1:1 at one end and many-to-one at the other, and the small end is exactly where a person notices, because a small library is one where every photo comes round often.

Two further facts make keeping renderings cheap rather than merely defensible. **The resolution space is small and stable** — clients ask at display sizes and widget-family sizes, so a real installation has perhaps five to ten distinct resolutions across every surface, not a continuum. And **a rendering is roughly a fifteenth of an original**: about 1.5 MB for a 4K frame against 25 MB for a 48-megapixel HEIC.

**So the cache becomes a set of `(photo, width, height)` entries, and the original is simply the entry at native size.** Where that set is *recorded* is the subject of the subsection after next, and the answer turns out to be neither `photo` nor a new table.

**Referenced versus materialized narrows to the native entry.** A boot-volume photo's native entry is a pointer rather than a copy, exactly as before; every rendering is always a real file, because a rendering has nothing to point at. The rule in *Reference in place on the internal volume* is unchanged, it simply applies to one row of the set rather than to the photo.

**And the cap becomes bytes alone. `cachePhotoCap` goes.** A count stopped meaning anything the moment one photo became an original plus four renderings, and it was always a poor proxy for the thing actually being protected — a thousand photos is somewhere between 2 GB and 100 GB depending on whether they are phone JPEGs or ProRAW. The byte ceiling was already in the design as a safety valve, secondary to the count; it becomes the primary and only control, and the *Choosing the shipping default* experiment measures a byte budget rather than a photo count.

#### Entries compete individually, so a photo can outlive its own original

The two halves have very different recreation costs. A lost rendering is about thirty milliseconds of subsampled decode. A lost original is a network download, possibly metered, possibly minutes. That asymmetry could argue for evicting whole photos together — all entries at once, which would keep the sliding-window story exactly as written and leave FIFO obviously correct.

**Entries compete individually instead, and the intermediate state that allows is a feature rather than a defect.** A photo whose original has been evicted but whose 3840×2160 rendering survives is completely serviceable to a wallpaper asking at 3840×2160 — it never needs the original again. Since a rendering is a fifteenth of the bytes, the same disk budget holds close to an order of magnitude more display-ready pictures. For the case this project actually runs in — a fixed set of displays, unchanged for months — that is most of the value on the table, and it costs only when a resolution appears that nobody has rendered: a new monitor, a resized window, one re-download.

**One invariant stops it thrashing: an original is never evicted while a render pending on it needs it.** That is the whole of the coordination, and it is a check against work in flight rather than a policy about deck position.

**FIFO survives at both ends**, which is the part that looks most likely to break. Renderings are created in deck order, the same as materialization, so oldest-created is still longest-since-dealt. On a large library renderings are 1:1 and eviction order is irrelevant to hit rate; on a small one the entire rendered set fits and nothing evicts at all. The awkward middle is where FIFO does least, and it is also where it costs least. The two existing guards are unchanged: nothing queued is ever evicted, and free space is checked before every fetch.

#### The index lives in RAM, and the filenames rebuild it

**The cache's metadata is not in the database.** It is an index in the service's memory, built at startup by walking the cache directory, and it is never written back.

The reasoning is not that persisting is hard — persisting is what would *avoid* reconstruct-or-discard on restart. It is that **reconstruction is nearly free, because the path already encodes the identity.** A directory walk plus one `stat` per file yields everything the index holds: which photo, which resolution, how many bytes, how old, what format. A few thousand entries is milliseconds, and even fifty thousand is about 5 MB of memory in a process that idles at 36.

**This inverts *Cache layout*,** which says "the database is the index — nothing ever finds a photo by scanning the filesystem." Now the filesystem is the index and the database copy was the denormalisation that could drift. And it is **Phase 1.5 that makes it possible**: while clients read the cache themselves they needed the database to find paths, so the index had to be somewhere shared. Now nobody but the service looks, so it can live in the process that owns it.

**Filenames rather than EXIF.** A `stat` is microseconds; opening and parsing image metadata across thousands of files at every launch is orders of magnitude more, on the startup path, to recover things the path already carries. EXIF would only buy self-description if the files were ever moved or copied somewhere, and nothing ever does that.

**`photo` gains a UUID, and the filename is exactly that UUID.**

```
cache/<source-uuid>/.original/<photo-uuid>.heic
cache/<source-uuid>/3840x2160/<photo-uuid>.heic
```

**The resolution is a path component rather than part of the name**, so a filename is one identifier and nothing else, and the rebuild stays a walk plus a `stat` with no parsing of any kind. `.original/` is a reserved name rather than the native pixel size — otherwise every photo's original lands in a directory named for its own dimensions, and hundreds of one-off directories sit mixed in with the handful of live display sizes. The leading dot makes the reservation structural rather than conventional: a resolution directory is `<w>x<h>` and can never begin with one, so nothing has to remember that a name is taken. It also makes *the original is just another resolution* literally true of the layout.

Source above resolution because `cache clear --source` is an operation that already exists and clear-by-resolution is not — though the second comes free in this order anyway: a monitor that goes away is one directory removal per source.

The UUID is a column beside the row id, not a replacement for it: `id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` stays as SQLite's rowid, because every index entry and every `queue.photo_id` references it and a 36-byte text key would inflate all of them on the table the deck reads at every deal. `uuid`, with a unique index, is the only identity that ever leaves the database.

**A row id would have been a silent corruption here, and it is worth being explicit about why.** The database is disposable — deleting it and rescanning is a legitimate recovery for any problem — and a rebuilt database renumbers from 1. With row ids in the filenames, a surviving cache would be *mis-attributed* rather than merely stale: photo 412's renderings served as photo 412, which is now a different picture entirely. Today that cannot happen only because `cache_path` lives in the database and dies with it; moving the index to the filesystem removes the thing that was protecting us.

**So the rule at startup is: if the UUID in the filename is not in the database, delete the file.** That single check is `sweepOrphans` generalised — it cleans up after a deleted photo, after a removed source, and after a rebuilt database, and in the last case it correctly discards the whole cache rather than serving it under someone else's name. A photo removed and re-added gets a new UUID and therefore a clean cache, which is the same rule *Removal is a real delete* already states: a file that comes back is a new entry with no history.

**Migration 4 is therefore a deletion, not an addition.** `cache_path` and `materialized_at` leave `photo` and nothing replaces them; `uuid` arrives, and so does one on `source`. `byte_size` stays, because it is scan metadata about the original rather than about our copy — and it is the column *Known shortcomings* item 2 wants a `modified_at` next to.

**What else it removes:**

- **`verifyResidency` goes entirely.** It exists because the database's claim about resident bytes can go stale against the disk. An index built *from* the disk cannot disagree with it.
- **`sweepOrphans` collapses into the startup rule** above, plus an unlink at removal time.
- ~~**One cheap startup step arrives** in their place: prune queue entries whose bytes the walk did not find.~~ Built, and removed 2026-08-24: once cards are dealt before their bytes exist, that prune deletes exactly the cards that would warm the cache — the launch purge under *What running it found*. A queued card without bytes is now the ordinary state a fetch resolves, so the queue and the index are not reconciled at launch at all.

**One invariant the scheme rests on, and it needs writing down: render to a temporary name and rename atomically.** With no database to cross-check, a truncated file left by a crash mid-write would be indexed as real and served as garbage. Atomic rename is what makes *present* mean *complete*.

**The per-source directory keeps both of its mechanical jobs** — `cache clear --source` stays one directory removal rather than thousands of unlinks, and per-source byte totals stay a directory size rather than a query and a stat loop. It is keyed by the source's UUID for the same reason the photo's is.

#### The write amplification, measured rather than pre-optimized

On a library large enough that renderings genuinely are 1:1, caching every one of them is about 13 GB of writes per day at a ten-second dwell, for no reads at all. That is nothing an SSD minds, and it belongs in the Phase 2 measurement rather than in a design decision.

**If it ever does matter, the discriminator is one comparison the system already has the numbers for**: keep the rendering when `pool_size` is smaller than the eviction horizon in cards — that is, when the photo will come round again before eviction would have taken it. No mode, no configuration, and no second policy to explain. It is deliberately not built now, because building it before the measurement exists would be designing against an imagined library.

### The resize cache is removed

**Reversed, decided and built 2026-09-16.** Syd, once the agent was resizing one picture at a time: "we should start caching the resized images again to reduce the workload on the resize queue", and "We will pretty much resize each picture once if there is a small number of pics in the sources and everything fits in the cache, and save the expensive HEIC resizer resource." Eviction: "based on LRU of the files themselves, and don't bother with removing resized images if the original is evicted", then "strictly based on creation date of the file, or an equivalent semantic in the database." Designed with Syd one question at a time and built the same day; `Agent Performance Overhaul.md`, Phase 2b and *The resize cache, proposed*. **The drifting box it describes was measured before deciding:** seven boxes in two and a half hours, five in use, and only the app's window drifts, only while it is resized — so copies are keyed by the box asked for. What follows is the 2026-09-06 decision, kept for its reasoning.

**Decided 2026-09-06, reversing 1.5.3 and *The cache becomes (photo, resolution), bounded by bytes*.** The service still renders every sized request to the box the client asked for; it no longer keeps the result. The cache holds originals and nothing else, so **serving can never grow it**, and a photograph is one file again.

**What broke the old argument was the key, not the pool size.** *The cache becomes (photo, resolution)* costed re-reads against pool size and concluded that a small library re-reads a rendering every seventeen minutes, which is true and is not the point. The key is `(photo, display box)` and the box is a client's window in pixels — so it drifts. Two windows two pixels apart are two keys holding the same picture twice; every resize starts a fresh set; a second surface at a different size doubles it again. The development cache held 3,137 renderings in 0.99 GB, and 882 MB of that was one source rendered at `1800x1066` and again at `1802x1068`. Set against a shuffle whose repeat window exists precisely to stop a photograph coming round soon, the hit rate was near zero at both ends of the range the old section argued over.

**The other claim it rested on was that renderings are cheap to remake, and that was an order of magnitude out.** Measured over 2,932 real originals rendered to an 1800px box and HEIC-encoded: 109 ms median, 181 ms p90, 670 ms worst of a 41-file sample; the ten largest files, averaging 38 MB in, came in at 295 ms median and 1063 ms worst. This plan said "tens of milliseconds" in three places. It is still affordable — the client is serial and asks at draw time, so the cost lands in the gap between pictures while the previous one is still on screen, never on a blank frame — but it was never as cheap as written, and the decision was made knowing the real number rather than the guessed one.

**The cache is a staging area for the queue, which is what it had already become.** That is the change that matters more than the bytes reclaimed. It was described as a prediction about what would be wanted soon, which is what justified a large budget and a sweep to find the right one. It is not that: the deck deals over every available photograph and the queue fetches its own cards, so what the cache holds is what the queue is carrying plus whatever has not been evicted yet. So the budget follows the queue — **twice its working set, rounded up: `2 × 20 × 2.95 MB` measured mean is 118 MB, so 1 GB** — replacing a guessed 10 GB and cancelling the 5 / 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 GB sweep, which had no knee to find.

**The point of a smaller number is somebody's disk, and it only bounds half of it.** On a laptop set to Optimize Mac Storage a photograph is on the volume twice: Photos downloads the original as purgeable space, and we materialize our own copy beside it. This bounds our half. It does nothing about theirs, which is the subject of *TODO: pulling originals fills the startup volume* and is not addressed by this.

**One consequence recorded at the time, since overtaken.** *Always show something, even a repeat* said a walk that finds nothing servable deals from what is already cached, and at 1 GB that fallback pool would have been a few hundred photographs rather than thousands. That fallback is no longer in the code; what an offline session shows is each unavailable source's held photographs — at 1 GB, still a few hundred — so the repetitiveness stands, accepted rather than solved.

**And it made an eviction bug visible that had been there all along** — see *Eviction*. The rank was `COALESCE(last_shown_at, cached_at, added_at)` where the prose in that section said "when anybody last had a reason to keep it", which is `MAX`. At a 10 GB ceiling eviction almost never ran and the difference never showed. At 1 GB it ran every tick, took from the front, and the front was thirteen queue cards fetched seconds earlier. Worth recording as a pattern: a tight budget is a test, and the second-order finding was worth more than the gigabyte.

#### What went

- `PhotoCache.keep` and `rendering(of:at:)`; `ServedPhoto.isRendering`.
- `fitting:` through `serve`, `bytesHere`, `firstQueuedWithBytes`, `waitForBytes` — the box existed so an evicted original could be answered from a rendering at exactly that size. *`serve` takes `fitting:` again since 2026-09-16, for the same reason: a card with no original is served from a resized copy kept for the box asked for.* `bytesHere` now only calls `residentURL`, which still resolves a referenced file in place.
- `PhotoStore.Size` and `PhotoStore.Key`. The key is a photograph's UUID; `.original` stays as the directory name so every cached original stayed where it was.
- `PhotoRenderer.Format.admitted(by:)`, whose only caller was the held-rendering branch. Every sized request is rendered fresh, so the format asked for is always the format returned.
- The `X-PGR-Cache` header and `ServedPicture.CacheState` on the client; `QueueEvent.rendered`; the `rendering:` flag on `QueueEvent.serving`; the `hit`/`miss` field on the request log, which could now only ever say `miss`.
- `PhotoStore.Entry.createdAt`, written and never read since eviction started ranking from the database. It predates this change.
- `CacheSettings.phone`. One set of numbers for every platform — see *The iOS variant*.
- A referenced photograph now occupies no cache bytes at all, which retired the eviction-order case that existed only because renderings were the one thing the cache held for one.

**A one-shot sweep reclaims what is on disk**, in `PhotoStore.index(photos:discardingUnclaimed:)`: any directory under a source that is not `.original` is deleted at launch and reported on the agent's console. It had to be explicit, because those renderings belong to photographs the database still claims and the unclaimed-file rule would never have taken them. It took 23 directories and 0.99 GB from the development cache. **It is temporary and marked so** — once every cache in use has launched once it can only sweep zero, and reading it later would suggest renderings are something the store still expects to find.

### A photo that will not render

The render joins the loop `serve` already runs. Today it pops, checks the photo is still in its source, and skips to the next queue entry when it is gone, answering *nothing* only when the queue is exhausted. **Rendering becomes the third step in that same loop**, so a photo that will not decode is skipped and the client gets the next one, rather than a `204` while the queue still holds two hundred good pictures.

**A photo that fails to render is blacklisted after three attempts.** Removing it from the pool does not work, and the reason is worth recording because it is not obvious: the file is still sitting on disk, so the next refresh finds it and adds it straight back. It would cycle for ever, burning a card each time round. Contrast a download whose provider confirms the file absent, where removal is right precisely because the file is gone — a failed read alone proves nothing, and only the confirmed absence deletes (settled 2026-08-24).

Four properties the blacklist needs:

- **A counter, not one strike.** A decode can fail from memory pressure or from a file caught mid-copy, and neither says anything permanent about the photo. Three, matching the client's retry count.
- **Somewhere that survives a rescan.** A column on `photo` does, since `upsert` keeps existing rows and only deletes when the file has gone.
- **One more clause in the candidate predicate**, alongside the repeat window. The producer's claim it once sat beside has left the predicate.
- **Visible and clearable from `pgr_ctl`.** **Half built**: `pgr_ctl deck stats` counts retired photographs, and `Deck.clearRenderFailures()` exists with no verb to call it. Otherwise a transient failure removes a photo from the library for good with nothing anywhere saying so, which is the failure this plan spends most of its effort avoiding.

### Revocation, and the staleness that is accepted

Darwin notifications carry no payload, which was exactly right while both ends shared the database: the notification said *go look* and SQLite held what there was to look at. Clients no longer have anything to look at, and a notification never left the machine anyway.

**This is post-0.1.** It was on Phase 1.5's absent list while the plan still expected the service to grow every client-facing endpoint before any client existed. Nothing holds a picture up today, so there is nothing for a revocation to interrupt — and once something does, the question of whether a picture vanishing under a viewer is better or worse than one that lingers is answerable by looking at it, which is not a thing that can be settled ahead of the surfaces.

The doorbell works again as soon as a client has an endpoint to look at:

- The service posts the Darwin notification — **outside world to local processes**, unchanged in mechanism.
- A client fetches `GET /v1/revocations?since=<cursor>` and drops anything it is holding.

The cursor is what lets a client that has been away fetch the delta rather than everything, and the list needs a bounded tail, for which `deck_event` is already the shape.

**Widgets and the Watch may show a revoked picture until they rotate it out, and that is accepted.** They cannot hear a local notification and they render ahead of time. What makes this tolerable is where the gap falls: the surfaces that miss it are showing small images that rotate on their own within the hour, while the wallpaper — which *Known shortcomings* item 10 calls the worst case, since it holds one picture for as long as the user leaves it — is local and does hear it.

**Darwin notifications keep exactly one job, and it is worth naming by direction.** Outside world to service, locally: `defaults write` reconfiguring a running agent with no cooperation from anything is still the property worth having, and both ends share the preferences domain, so *go look* is still sufficient there. Service to clients is HTTP.

### Every device serves itself, so the service never leaves the machine

**Nothing off the Mac talks to the Mac's service.** Each platform runs its own, and the one relationship that crosses a device boundary is the one that already existed: the Watch is fed by its paired iPhone.

- **The Mac** runs the agent and serves its own surfaces over `localhost` — the app, the screensaver, the wallpaper, the widgets, `curl`.
- **iOS and iPadOS** run service and client in one process, for the reason *The iOS family* already gives: a local HTTP server there is suspended along with the app the moment it backgrounds.
- **The Watch** is fed by the phone over `WCSession`, which is where the dependency was always going to be, since watchOS has no sources of its own.
- **tvOS and visionOS** are unanswered and are a to-do rather than a design — see the ledger.

**That removes a great deal.** No Bonjour, so no `NSBonjourServices`, no `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`, and no Local Network prompt to reason about on three platforms. No App Transport Security question about cleartext to a `.local` address. No bearer token, no on-screen code entry on an Apple TV, and no paired phone acting as credential broker. No NAT traversal, relay, or cloud endpoint for a cellular watch — which was the tier that ran straight into *Nothing is shipped anywhere*. And **the Mac no longer has to be awake for anything but its own surfaces**, which was the standing weakness of a design where other devices depended on it.

**The listener binds loopback and stays there.** Authorization drops from real work to a question about local processes, which is a much weaker threat model than every device on the Wi-Fi: a process that can already reach the loopback interface on this Mac is a process running as this user.

### What this collapses elsewhere

The point of recording these together is that they are the return on the change, and several of them are the hardest unknowns in the plan.

- **The Phase 6 spike shrinks to one question.** "Can a saver inside `legacyScreenSaver` read the cache and write the deck" becomes "can it make an HTTP request," and the four-rung ladder is resolved before the spike runs.
- **The consumption journal fallback goes away**, since it existed only for a saver that could not write.
- **The Phase 8 spike may go away entirely.** Confirming an unsandboxed Developer ID server and a sandboxed widget extension can share an App Group container stops mattering when the widget makes a request instead. `MacHostEnvironment.appGroupIdentifier`, kept deliberately for Phases 5 and 8, was deleted on that reasoning; `directoryName` still has a job.
- **Cross-process concurrency becomes one process's internal business.** WAL, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, and the two-processes-one-deck tests stop being a distributed story. The claim still earns its place — now the queue fetcher's — because the service runs four fetches at once across the whole queue.

### What it costs

- **The service has to be up.** Nothing needed anything else to be running before this. launchd was to buy most of it back — socket activation for a listener, so a client connecting starts the agent — and it moved the login item from Phase 6 to Phase 3. **As built there is no socket activation**: the agent binds its own port and publishes it. The `SMAppService.agent(plistName:)` `.notFound` this put on the critical path was stepped around on 2026-09-10 by a per-user plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, which is decided and not yet built.
- **A second implementation of the client seam**, in-process for iOS and HTTP for everything else. Small, and it is where the retry policy lives.
- **The reachability tiers above**, of which the third has no cheap answer.

### Alternatives considered and rejected here

- **Server-Sent Events with a two-phase download.** Client asks, service answers later with a download ID, client collects it. Rejected: the queue means there is nothing to wait for, a widget extension cannot hold the stream open to hear the answer, and holding a rendered file between the two calls is a reservation with a reaper — the hand design, returning under another name. SSE stays available if a genuine push need appears; revocation did not turn out to be one, because a payload-free notification plus a list endpoint does the same job for the clients that can hear it.
- **A Node service.** Attractive because HTTP makes the transport language-agnostic, but the service is the one component that cannot be: there is no Node binding for PhotoKit and the file inside a `.photoslibrary` is undocumented and TCC-protected, so a Node service cannot get an original out of an iCloud-optimized library at all; TCC attaches to a signed bundle, so Photos access would be granted to the Node binary; fit-to-size means `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex`, against which the Node answer is a native module tree in a project that refuses even Apple's argument parser; and Phase 7's `NSWorkspace.setDesktopImageURL` needs a Swift helper regardless, at which point "no Apple dependencies" is already false.
- **A C core, or running the service in AWS.** The portability argument does not require leaving Swift, which builds for Linux — a headless instance is a build target rather than a rewrite, with the Photos provider compiled in only where it exists. What actually decides where the service can run is **not the language but the geography of the photos**: it has to reach the bytes to serve them, and a folder is on a disk while a Photos library is on that Mac under TCC. A cloud instance would mean uploading a second copy of what iCloud already stores — roughly 200 GB for a fifty-thousand-photo library, at rest and paid for, plus egress — and it contradicts *Nothing is shipped anywhere* outright. **Phase 11 is the exception worth remembering**: Google Photos does not care where the service runs, because the bytes were never local, and a cloud instance serving from it needs no upload and no Mac awake at three in the morning.
- **The whole thing dispensed with, keeping the database as the transport.** This was the plan until Phase 1.5. It fails on the surfaces that are the point of the project: it requires every sandboxed client to obtain file access to the container and the cache, and it cannot reach a Watch or an Apple TV at all.

### What `pgr_ctl` stops needing to do

The service's whole surface is curl-able by construction, which retires part of the rig rather than reimplementing it.

**`serve` dissolves into a shell loop.** `curl -w '%{time_total}\n'` yields the per-request timing that `serve` was computing percentiles over, and the concurrency proof gets *better* rather than worse: four backgrounded `curl` invocations exercise the real client path over the wire, where four `pgr_ctl serve` processes were exercising a path no shipping surface will ever take. This is the same argument *`pgr_ctl`, the command-line tool* already makes for the cache-cap sweep being "a shell loop over `pgr_ctl` invocations, not a bespoke benchmark harness."

**What survives is what is not a service operation**: preferences — `get`, `set`, and the `sources` verbs, which are preferences writes by design — plus `shuffle-test`, `notify`, and `log`. **The inspection verbs stayed as well, and did not become renderings of JSON endpoints**, because those endpoints were never built: `status`, `pool stats`, `queue peek` and `fill`, `deck stats`, and `cache status`, `evict`, and `clear` open the database directly, as do `photos-spike` and the `register` verbs. See `Documentation/pgr_ctl.md`.

**`shuffle-test` keeps earning its place because a curl loop cannot assert.** It exits non-zero, which is what lets CI run the deck's correctness checks exactly as a person does.

### What this revised, elsewhere in this document

The reversal is recorded rather than quietly absorbed, because the old text was not vague — it was specific and wrong, and two readers took opposite meanings from it. Each passage below has been rewritten in place; this is the list of where, so nobody reads the current text and assumes it always said this.

1. *Design Decisions* — "**Between our own components: the database is the transport, a Darwin notification is the doorbell.** No HTTP server, no sockets, no XPC." True of the control channel, no longer true of how a picture reaches a surface.
2. *Design Decisions* — "**\"Calls it\" means the database and a Darwin notification, not a socket.**" The Mac app becomes a client of the service.
3. *The service does one thing* — "the database is the transport, so anything that wants to inspect or change the library opens it directly." Still true of `pgr_ctl` and of `defaults write`. Not true of displays.
4. *What a client asks for, and what it gets back* — step 4, "the client reads the card and loads the image," and "The database is the transport and the notification is the doorbell." Steps 1 through 3 survive intact.
5. *Decode on demand; do not store derivatives* — the widget exception is absorbed rather than kept, and **the argument against a derivative tier no longer holds at small pool sizes**, where a rendering is re-read every few minutes rather than once. Renderings are cached; originals stay as the render source. The in-memory decoded-image cache at display time is unaffected. **Reversed 2026-09-06: the derivative tier is gone and this line's original title was right after all, though not for the reason it gave — see *The resize cache is removed*.** The in-memory cache is still unaffected.
6. *Design Decisions* — "**The cache is capped by photo count, FIFO, default 1000.**" The bound becomes bytes alone and `cachePhotoCap` goes; FIFO and both guards stand.
7. *Cache layout* and *Eviction* — the on-disk path is keyed by UUID and gains a resolution component, and eviction ranges over `(photo, resolution)` entries rather than over photos. *Choosing the shipping default* now measures a byte budget.
8. *Cache layout* — "the database is the index — nothing ever finds a photo by scanning the filesystem" is inverted. The filesystem is the index; the service reads it once at startup into RAM and never writes it back. `verifyResidency` and `sweepOrphans` go with it.
9. *Reference in place on the internal volume* — unchanged in substance, but it now describes the native entry rather than the photo.
10. *Apple Watch* — "the phone keeps a small rolling set of watch-sized derivatives on the watch" becomes "the watch asks at its own size." The companion decision itself stands, on sourcing grounds rather than on reachability.
11. *Phase 6* — the spike ladder "Direct container access, then localhost HTTP, then XPC, with a consumption journal as fallback" is resolved to HTTP in advance.
12. *Phase 8* — the App Group spike may no longer be needed.
13. *Phase 2* — `pgr_ctl` has no picture path at all. Taking a picture is `curl` against the service, so the tool covers only what is not a service operation: preferences, the statistical rig, the doorbell, and the log.
14. *`pgr_ctl`, the command-line tool* — the subcommand sketch lists `serve`, and "It has a head start" names it as written. `serve` is retired in favour of `curl`; see *What `pgr_ctl` stops needing to do* above.

## The service does one thing

`Photos-Go-Round Server` runs the queue. That is the entire command surface, and the constraint is deliberate rather than incidental.

**It takes no command word, because there is nothing to choose between.** There was a `run` verb for a while, and it was pure ceremony: a program with one behaviour that makes you name the behaviour is asking a question with one answer. It survived only because the inspect verbs bound for `pgr_ctl` were still sharing the binary and made it look like a subcommand among subcommands. A bare invocation now runs the agent; an unrecognised word is still an error rather than a silent start, so a typo cannot launch a server by accident.

A service that also answers questions is a service with two jobs, and the second one grows: first a status verb, then a way to add a source, then a way to change a preference, and now the thing that is supposed to be running unattended for a week has an interactive surface nobody is watching. Worse, it makes the service the *place* configuration happens, when the architecture says otherwise — sources and settings live in `UserDefaults`, so anything that wants to change the library writes there and never needs the agent's cooperation at all. Handing out pictures is a different matter and is the service's actual job; see *The service is the interface*. **The source endpoints later gave it a second job of the kind this warns about**, writing preferences on a client's behalf; *The database is private to the service* argues why that was the cheapest price on offer.

**So the service is configured, not commanded.** Everything it needs to know arrives before it starts:

```
PGR_CONTAINER=…  PGR_FOLDERS=…  PGR_RECURSIVE=1  "Photos-Go-Round Server"
```

and everything else — what it found, what it has queued, what it will show next — is answered by `pgr_ctl`, which opens the database, and at a glance by the agent's dashboard, while preferences are read and written directly in their domain. Configuration therefore still works with the service stopped, which is the property that made this design worth having; pictures, by definition, do not.

**One consequence worth stating**: the service has no consumers of its own, so a staged agent fills the queue and then waits. That is correct and looks like nothing happening. Watching it do something means `curl` against `/v1/next` in another terminal, or Phase 3's window.

## `pgr_ctl`, the command-line tool

A Swift executable in the same package, driving the server directly. It is Phase 2 because Phase 1 has no UI, and it keeps earning its place afterward because there are things a command line does that a window cannot.

The obvious value is that the server becomes demonstrable on its own — sources added, a library refreshed, a queue filled, pictures served, all before a single view exists. The less obvious value is that it makes the shuffle *testable in the way shuffles actually need to be tested*, which is statistically. "Does this feel random?" is not a question a GUI can answer. "Deal fifty thousand cards across four thousand photos and assert every pass contains every photo exactly once, then report the distribution of gaps between consecutive showings of the same photo" is a question a command-line tool answers in a script, in a second, repeatably.

The subcommands, as `Documentation/pgr_ctl.md` lists them on 2026-09-12:

```
pgr_ctl status
pgr_ctl sources {add [--folder [--recursive] <path>] [--file <path>] [--album <id>] … | list | remove <id> | enable <id> | disable <id>}
pgr_ctl refresh
pgr_ctl pool stats
pgr_ctl queue {peek [-n <count>] | fill [-n <rounds>]}
pgr_ctl deck stats
pgr_ctl cache {status | evict | clear [--source <id>] [--unavailable] [--yes]}
pgr_ctl shuffle-test [--deals <n>] [--photos <n>] [-w <fraction>]
pgr_ctl get [<key>] | set <key> <value>
pgr_ctl notify <topic>
pgr_ctl log [-f] [--last <time>]
```

**`register`, `unregister` and `service-status` were removed 2026-09-19.** They drove `SMAppService`, which needs a plist inside the bundle that only `Scripts/make-agent-bundle.sh` ever wrote — and that script went when `xcodebuild` became the single build route. Installing the agent is `pgr_install agent`, run by ⌘R on the **Install Agent** scheme, which writes a per-user plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`. Syd: "they go too."

`refresh` rings the doorbell and returns, so it takes no `--source`; see *`pgr_ctl` keeps the database, and never speaks HTTP*.

**It is internal and never ships.** It is not in the distributed bundle, gets no signing or notarization pipeline, needs no polished ergonomics — it has a man page all the same, because every command gets one — and carries no compatibility promise — subcommands can change shape whenever a phase makes that convenient. It exists for us, on this machine.

Four notes on building it:

- **No argument-parsing package.** `swift-argument-parser` is Apple's, but it is still an SPM dependency, and the no-dependencies rule does not have an Apple exception. Hand-rolled parsing for a dozen subcommands is an afternoon and about two hundred lines.
- **It goes through the same public kit API as every other host.** The temptation to let a debug tool reach past the API into raw SQL should be resisted for the same reason it should be in the app: a harness that bypasses the interface tests nothing.
- **Being unshipped does not make it a scratch script.** No compatibility promise is not the same as no rigor: the assertions it runs are the project's real correctness checks for the deck, so they belong in version control and in CI alongside the unit tests.
- **It doubles as the measurement rig.** The cache-cap experiment — fill times and cache-miss rates across caps of 250 through 4000 — is a shell loop over `pgr_ctl` invocations, not a bespoke benchmark harness. Same for validating that serving actually serialises: run several `curl` requests concurrently and assert the union of what they got has no duplicates — which exercises the real client path rather than one no shipping surface will take.

**It has a head start.** `source`, `status`, `queue peek`, `get` and `set` are written, because standing the agent up needed a way to see what it thought was happening. They live in `pgr_ctl` from the outset rather than as subcommands of the server.

**There is no `serve`, and no download verb at all.** Phase 1.5 makes the service's whole surface curl-able, so taking a picture off the head of the queue is `curl` and timing it is `curl -w '%{time_total}\n'`. What stays here is what is *not* a service operation — preferences, the statistical rig, the doorbell, and the log. See *What `pgr_ctl` stops needing to do*.

Between them, `pgr_ctl` and the Mac app cover the two halves of the problem: the command line for anything scriptable, statistical, or repeatable, and the app for anything visual, interactive, or timing-dependent.

## The database is private to the service

Settled in Phase 3, and written up as a reversal rather than folded in quietly, because it revises several statements above and because the reasoning is what matters rather than the conclusion.

**No client opens the database.** Not the app, not the screensaver, not a widget — every claim about the library a client needs, and every change it wants to make, goes over HTTP to the agent. `pgr_ctl` is the deliberate exception and stays one: it is the rig rather than a client, and *`pgr_ctl` keeps the database* below says why.

**What prompted it was small and the answer is not.** A settings panel needs to show photo counts per source, and every way of getting them was bad. The app could open the database itself, which means a second process holding locks and a second bundle needing file-access consent. It could shell out to `pgr_ctl`, which never ships, has no compatibility promise, and could not be spawned from a sandbox. **Or the service could answer, which is where this landed** — at the price of giving the service a second job, which is the cheapest of the three prices on offer.

**The decision is about encapsulation, not convenience.** SQLite is a choice the agent should be able to unmake. Today's schema is the twelfth migration of a store that had lost `cache_path`, `materialized_at`, `verifyResidency`, and `sweepOrphans` by the fourth, and *the database is disposable* says outright that it can be deleted and rebuilt at the cost of a rescan. A store that disposable should not have three programs reaching into it. Keeping it private is what makes replacing it later a decision rather than an excavation.

### Clients ask over HTTP

The service already hands out pictures on loopback. It also answers questions about the library, and takes changes to it:

```
GET    /v1/sources           the list, with counts and availability
POST   /v1/sources           add one or more, all or none
GET    /v1/sources/<uuid>    one source, with the options it was added with
PATCH  /v1/sources/<uuid>    change one of those options
DELETE /v1/sources/<uuid>    remove one
```

That is the whole client-facing surface for sources. **Preferences are not a client transport**, which is the reversal below.

`/v2/sources` carries the same five routes over every kind, Photos albums included, and since 2026-09-07 one more: `POST /v2/sources/<uuid>/reconnect`, which points a missing album at the one album in the library now that it was called and where it sat — 200 with the moved source, 409 naming the candidates when there were none or several, 400 for anything that is not a missing album. See `Apple Photos Plan.md` for the versioning and `Missing Albums Plan.md` for the reconnect.

### Preferences as a client transport, tried and reversed

Recorded because it was built and undone, and because the reasons are the useful part rather than the conclusion.

The idea was that the agent publishes what it found into `sourceStatus`, clients read it, and clients write `sources` themselves. The attractions are real: it needs no agent running, it crosses every process boundary for free, `defaults read` shows the whole thing, and `servicePort` already proves the pattern works.

What it cannot do, and every one of these bites a settings panel specifically:

- **There is no return value.** Adding a source can fail — a path that stopped resolving between the dialog and the write, a folder the agent is refused access to — and publication has nowhere to say so. "Did that work?" degrades into "wait and see whether a count appears."
- **Two writers, one array, no transaction.** The app and `pgr_ctl` both rewriting `sources` is a lost update waiting to happen, and `UserDefaults` has no compare-and-swap to prevent it.
- **It is eventually consistent.** `cfprefsd` flushes on its own schedule, so a panel that writes and re-reads can watch its own change arrive late.
- **Every reader reimplements the join.** Two arrays keyed by locator, merged by hand, in every client that will ever exist.
- **No versioning, no authorization.** A shape change breaks every reader silently, and there is no boundary at which to notice.

An endpoint answers all five: a status code, a single writer, a synchronous response, one joined representation, and a version in the path.

### What preferences are still for

Narrowed to the agent's side, not abolished.

- **The durable source list.** `sources` is still where what-the-user-chose lives, still the thing the `source` table is a projection of, still readable and repairable with `defaults`. What changes is that a client no longer writes it — the service does, on the client's behalf.
- **Discovery.** `servicePort` cannot be an endpoint, because you need it to find the endpoints. Preferences are the only answer to that chicken and egg.
- **Settings.** Every tuning preference is untouched: `defaults write` still reconfigures a running agent with no cooperation from it, which is a stated property of this design and stays one.
- **Bootstrap.** `pgr_ctl` writes preferences directly, which is what keeps a library configurable with nothing running.

### Requiring the agent is not a cost

The obvious objection is that a client can no longer add a source with the agent stopped, and that adding the first one is exactly when nothing is running. It does not survive contact with what a client is for.

**A client with no agent has nothing to do.** It cannot show a photograph, because pictures come from the service, and the empty state for a stopped agent already exists and already says so. Adding a source in that condition would configure a library that can produce nothing until the agent starts, so the ability buys a few seconds of ordering rather than a capability.

The property that actually matters is untouched: **configuring this library never requires the agent to be up**, because `pgr_ctl` writes preferences directly. The rig covers the cold case; a client covers the case where there is a running system to talk to. The app is to be what registers the agent — not built yet; see `MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md`, *The app brings its own agent* — so a user who has one will have the other.

### The doorbell, and the batching it still demands

`.sourcesChanged` keeps its job: `pgr_ctl` writes preferences and rings it, the agent notices within a tick. What goes away is the agent publishing *back* through the same channel, and with it the hazard of the agent announcing to itself a change it had just made.

The batching rule survives and applies to the endpoint too. `addSource` posts per call, so a two-hundred-file selection asks the agent to refresh two hundred times; `addSources` merges and writes once. `POST /v1/sources` therefore takes an array rather than one source, and one request is one write and one doorbell.

### Which identity a source has

Sources have had a durable identity since the first schema: `Source.uuid`, minted when the row is inserted, and already load-bearing — `PhotoStore` uses it to name where that source's bytes live and to clear them. The row *id* is the unstable thing, and this document already says so: "a row id in a disposable database, so deleting the library renumbers sources from 1."

**A second identity in preferences was tried and rejected.** The argument for it was that it would survive deleting the database, which `Source.uuid` does not. The argument against is that it gives one concept two UUIDs — a reader of the schema and a reader of `defaults read` would see different values for the same folder — and it buys less than it appears to: **a deleted database costs the cache regardless**, because photo rows are re-minted too and the cache index is rebuilt from filenames with anything unclaimed deleted. Durability across a rebuild was the whole case for it, and the cache does not survive one anyway.

So there is one identity and it lives in the database. Two consequences follow:

- **Preferences address a source by locator**, which is what the user chose and what `reconcile` already matches on. `addSources` and `removeSources` are locator-keyed, and so is the panel's remove. **A folder's locator ends in a slash**, decided in `SourceSpec.init` so that a path from a picker and a path typed on a command line are the same string — two spellings of one identity is two sources that cannot remove each other.
- **The row id is what a *log line* names a source by.** `source 6` in a log line is `#6` in `pgr_ctl sources list`, beside the path, and a uuid is thirty-six characters of nothing to hold on to when you are reading a console. The instability that disqualifies it as an identity does not matter for a line somebody is reading now.
- **The UUID is what a client names a source by**, since it is what `GET /v1/sources` returns and what `PATCH` and `DELETE /v1/sources/<uuid>` take. It is stable where the row id is not — and a `PATCH` is what keeps changing an option from costing a source its identity, its cache directory, and its deal history, which remove-and-re-add would.

`pgr_ctl sources remove`, `enable`, and `disable` keep taking a row id, because they open the database and always will.

### WAL stays, for a different reason than it arrived

*Raw SQLite* justifies WAL by multi-process safety, and the tempting conclusion from single-process ownership is that it can go. It cannot, and the reason has moved inside the agent rather than disappearing.

`PictureEndpoint` opens **a connection per request** deliberately — "a `Database` belongs to one isolation domain and WAL is what makes several of them safe, so concurrent requests get their own rather than serialising behind a lock" — while the producer and the fetcher hold their own. *The maintenance pass was the other until 2026-09-16, when eviction moved to after each write.* A rollback journal would put concurrent requests behind a single writer lock.

What single-process ownership does retire is the cross-process half: no other program holding a read lock, no sidecars anything else opens, and no way for a tool and the agent to be looking at different containers — which is the most common way to waste twenty minutes here.

### `pgr_ctl` keeps the database, and never speaks HTTP

Worth being explicit, because "the database is private to the service" sounds like it ought to apply to everything and does not.

**Clients ask over HTTP** — the app, the screensaver, the widgets. They cannot open the database and should not want to: some are sandboxed, some are on other machines, all of them want an answer with a status code. They are what the private-database rule exists for.

**`pgr_ctl` is not a client.** It is the rig: internal, never shipped, and allowed to know exactly how the library is stored. It reads and writes preferences and opens the database directly, which is what lets every one of its verbs work with **no agent running** — the state a rig is most needed in. Nothing about it changes.

**`refresh` asks rather than does.** It rings the doorbell and returns; the agent walks the sources and reports what it found on its own console. Doing the walk here meant enumerating a network share twice — once in the rig, once in the agent — and blocking a terminal for minutes with nothing to look at, because a refresh only prints what *changed*. The doorbell carries no payload, so `--source` is refused rather than quietly ignored.

**It will not gain HTTP verbs either.** Command-line HTTP is `curl`, which is already how a picture is taken from a terminal and is documented that way in `README.md`. A second HTTP client inside the rig would duplicate that for nothing and hand the tool the dependency it exists to avoid.

The consequence worth keeping: **the two views can disagree, and that is useful.** `pgr_ctl` sees the store; a client sees what the service says about the store. When they differ, the difference is the bug, and two independent windows onto it are what make it findable.

### What this revised, elsewhere in this document

- **The agent is *configured, not commanded*, and `POST /v1/sources` is a command.** That sentence opens `photogoroundd`'s description and is now half true: the agent is still *configured* by flags, environment, preferences, and `pgr_ctl`, none of which need it running — and it is *additionally* commanded by clients, which cannot reach preferences meaningfully. The property underneath survives and is the one that mattered: **configuring this library never requires the agent to be up.**
- **`Identifiers` said `pgr_ctl` owns preference writes.** It still does, for the command line. What is new is that the service also writes them, on behalf of a client that asked over HTTP. Nothing writes them by naming a domain, which was the rule's actual purpose.
- *Raw SQLite and hand-written SQL* justified WAL by multi-process access. WAL stays; the justification is now the agent's own per-request connections.
- *The database holds state; `UserDefaults` holds preferences* keeps one published exception, `servicePort`, and no longer needs a second.
- **`sourceStatus` was built and is superseded.** Per-source counts and availability published into preferences, replaced by `GET /v1/sources` before anything consumed it. `Preferences.publishSourceStatus`, `Preferences.sourceStatus`, `SourceStatus`, `SourceStore.statuses()`, and the three publish calls in `RunCommand` are all deleted — nothing called them, and the endpoint can grow what it needs when it exists. `SourceRequest` and `Preferences.addSources` survive, because `pgr_ctl` uses both.
- *The Mac app as instrument panel* said the app manages no sources. See `MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md`.
- **Phase 1.5.3 said an unclaimed file is deleted at the rebuild, and left it at that.** It still is, but that is now the backstop rather than the only reclaim: removing a source deletes its cache directory at once, and a photograph that leaves a source takes its bytes with it. See *Rows and bytes leave together*.
- **A source's state was reachable-or-not, and is now three.** *Never showing a photo the user deleted* carried a three-valued answer for the *photograph* while the source underneath it had two, so a deleted folder and an unplugged drive were the same fact. They are not, and only one of them deletes anything.

## The agent's dashboard

Built 2026-09-12 and 2026-09-13, in slices, each run through the test suites before the next began. **Stood up against live agents on 2026-09-14**, on the laptop and on Plex, and Syd reported everything fine on both. Everything below is what was built and why; running it found nothing to change.

```
GET /dashboard                             a page for a browser
GET /v1/dashboard                          what the page shows, as JSON
GET /v1/dashboard/thumbnail?photo=<id>     a small JPEG of one photograph
```

What was asked for: a thumbnail of the last image served; how many pictures are in the database; how many are in the cache; disk space in the cache against the cache size; pictures served since launch, from wallpaper, screensaver, and app; any error messages consistently reported. Then, as it was being built: updated in real time; cache hits and misses since launch; the numbers following changed preferences; a caption naming the source and file; that name in the logs and available to the app; and a link in the About box. On 2026-09-13: cache evictions, and cache hits and misses on the fetch side as well as the serve side; then photographs added and removed since launch, by source, in the database panel; the error messages behind failed fetches; and errors taken off the panel a minute after they stop, with standing conditions kept until they clear. The man page's *SERVICE → Dashboard* is the reference for the JSON.

### Why the agent serves it

**Because an installed agent's console goes nowhere.** A LaunchAgent's stdout is not something anybody reads, and its unified log has to be dug out with `log show` and a predicate. Syd, on why this is wanted at all: easier than tracking down the logs of a LaunchAgent once it is installed.

**The About box is the way in because it shows the port.** The agent takes a new port every launch, so the link's text is the URL itself, re-read every two seconds while the box is open, and it opens in the default browser — Syd was explicit that it should not be a web view in the app. With no port published it says "Waiting for Photos", the window's words for the same thing — "Photo-Go-Round Is Not Running" until 2026-09-16. *Since 2026-09-26 the window says "Starting…" and the About box does not follow it: Syd, "keep the about box as it is."*

**The link is hidden until asked for, since 2026-09-24.** Syd: "I like having the link in both About and Settings if you are pressing the option key when invoking the menu". Choosing *About* or *Settings…* with Option held shows it — in the About box under the version, and in Settings as a fourth panel, *Support*. Each choice of the item decides again, so choosing it without Option hides the link from a window already open. ⌥⌘, does not reach the Settings item. `DashboardDisclosure`, in `MacOS/Desktop/Sources/AboutView.swift`. The agent's refusal text and the page's "not allowed" line still say to open the dashboard from the About box, without naming Option, so a refusal does not give the hidden action away.

**The page is three files beside the agent's sources and draws itself.** `MacOS/Agent/Dashboard/Resources/` holds `dashboard.html`, `dashboard.css` and `dashboard.js`; the `Photos-Go-Round Server` target copies them into the agent's bundle, and an agent with no bundle reads them from that folder. They were one string in the binary until 2026-09-16; Syd: "these files should go in the same directory the agent sources are in, with a subdirectory /js". No numbers are written into the HTML; its script asks `/v1/dashboard` and fills them in.

### Real time is a poll

**Once a second, starting after the last answer rather than on a fixed interval.** The listener closes every connection after one response, which is what removed the keep-alive state machine from it; pushing over server-sent events would mean giving it back a long-lived connection. A poll against loopback is a few milliseconds.

**The dashboard's routes are quiet.** They write no console line and no log record per request, and the router checks for them before the pictures — unclaimed, an open page would be a 404 in the request log sixty times a minute.

### Since launch, in memory

**Served counts, photographs added and removed, cache lookups on both sides, evictions, the last picture, and the error record are all in memory and gone at exit.** "Since launch" is the question; a count that survived a restart would answer a different one, and `photo.times_delivered` is already the durable per-photograph record.

**Served is counted per `consumer` as named, and only on a `200`.** `cli` and `anonymous` are counted beside wallpaper, screensaver, and app, because a total that left them out would disagree with the console. The count is taken in `PictureEndpoint.report`, which every request already passes through exactly once, so it cannot drift from the request log.

### Cache hits and misses, on two sides

The resize cache that used to report `hit` and `miss` went on 2026-09-06, so the words needed a new meaning. **There turned out to be two, and Syd asked for both on 2026-09-13**: one for serving, which will almost always hit, and one for fetching, which on a large library will miss a lot. They are two panels, and the JSON field that was `lookups` became `serveLookups`, beside `fetchLookups`.

**The serve side** is taken from what `PhotoCache.serve` actually decides.

- **A serve lookup is a queued card reaching the head with its photograph materialized.** A referenced photograph is its own file on the boot volume and never touches the cache; counting it would flatter the hit rate with every local folder.
- **A hit is the original already there.** A miss is not, and ends one of four ways: `landed`, waited for and arrived; `timedOut`, waited for and did not; `leftDuringWait`, its fetch failed while it was being waited for; `droppedWithoutWaiting`, the request's one wait was already spent or the source is benched.
- **Four, where three were agreed.** `leftDuringWait` was found in the code while building it: the card leaves the queue during the wait, which is neither an arrival nor a timeout, and folding it into either would have made that line say something untrue.
- **One lookup per card met, not per request.** A request walks past cold cards before serving one, so hits and misses together exceed pictures served, and the difference is the walking.

The kit reports serve lookups through `PhotoCache.lookedUp`, a closure that does nothing by default; the agent wires it to its tally.

**The fetch side** is taken from what dealing finds.

- **A fetch lookup is a materialized card being dealt.** A hit is its original already in the cache, so nothing needs fetching; a miss is not, and the card goes to the queue's fetcher. Referenced photographs are counted on neither side.
- **Counted at the deal, not at the fetcher**, because the fetcher's query only returns queued cards whose originals are not held — counted there, it would never see a hit.
- **What became of each fetch is counted too**: fetched, failed, timed out, from the result the agent's fetch closure already returns. These are not a breakdown of the misses. A miss whose card was served cold or dropped before its fetch finished — or whose source is benched — has no outcome, and is left uncounted rather than shown as a number that would blur with fetches still running; and a fetch for a card dealt before launch has an outcome and no miss, so on a restart the outcomes can briefly outnumber the misses.
- **Dealing runs on `FillerBox`'s own connection**, so `PhotoCache.dealLookedUp` is wired through `FillerBox` the way its event log is, set before the first fill because the filler is built once. The outcomes are recorded where `RunCommand` handles each fetch's result, which is why the tally is now made before the fetcher.

### Evictions

**What eviction took from the cache since launch**, added 2026-09-13 *(as "what the agent's maintenance took"; since 2026-09-16 eviction follows every file written, not a maintenance pass — see* Eviction*)*: photographs evicted, bytes freed, the passes that evicted anything, when the last of them ran, and whether that pass was aiming at half the ceiling because free space was below `cacheCriticalFreeBytes` — eviction driven by the disk rather than by the cache's size. `PhotoCache.EvictionResult` gained `ceilingHalved` to say so, and the console's eviction line says it too.

- **The agent's own passes only.** `pgr_ctl cache evict` and `cache clear` run in another process and are not seen; bytes that left because their photograph or source left the library are not evictions.
- **A pass that evicted nothing is not counted**, and does not move the last-eviction time.

### Added and removed, by source

**Asked for on 2026-09-13**: in the photos-in-the-database panel, the total number of photographs added or removed since launch, broken down by source. The panel keeps its total and gains a row per source that has changed, `+added −removed`, with a total row; the JSON field is `libraryChanges`.

- **Counted where the rows are written, not where a change is noticed.** A photograph enters `photo` one way, a refresh's upsert, and leaves it four: a refresh that no longer finds it, a fetch whose source confirms it gone, a serve whose source confirms it gone, and its source being removed. The first three all go through `PhotoPool`, and the fourth is a cascade from `SourceStore.remove(id:)`, so that is where `LibraryChanges` is told — a fifth way of noticing a change is counted without anybody remembering to.
- **Told after the transaction commits**, so a batch that rolled back is not counted. A source's photographs are counted and deleted in one transaction, so a refresh landing a batch between the two cannot be deleted uncounted.
- **Counted as events rather than derived** from `added_at` and a per-source count taken at launch. The derivation drifts from nothing, but a photograph added and removed in the same run would have been in neither number.
- **A photograph already in the library through another source is not added**, because its row is not written.
- **A removed source keeps its name**, taken from its row as it goes, and is marked removed. The rest are named as they are called now.
- **`LibraryChanges` is in the kit, and shared**, like `AgentErrors`, because a `PhotoPool` is made per connection all over the agent; only `RunCommand.run` starts it recording. `pgr_ctl` writes the same tables from another process and is not seen.

### Preferences are followed, and the one that does not exist

**A changed `cacheByteCeiling` or `queueSize` is in the next reading.** `Preferences` keeps no copy, and the dashboard builds its `PhotoCache` from the current values on every poll. How soon after a write is `cfprefsd`'s business: at once after the doorbell, within the agent loop's thirty-second re-read after a bare `defaults write`. **The cache itself shrinks to a lowered ceiling only when the agent next writes a file to it** — *until 2026-09-16, at the next maintenance pass* — so the page can read over a hundred per cent until then, which is true rather than a fault.

**There is no picture-count preference for the cache.** It was asked for as "number of pictures in cache"; `cachePhotoCap` went in Phase 1.5.3 and the only cache bounds are bytes. What the page shows instead is the queue's depth against `queueSize`, the nearest count-shaped setting. The last comment in `RunCommand` naming `cachePhotoCap` was removed the same day.

### The last picture, and what it is called

**The thumbnail takes no card and counts as nothing served.** It renders the original — in the cache, or in place — at 480 pixels either way, JPEG whatever the browser accepts, and is fetched only when the photograph changes. **Since 2026-09-16 it waits its turn on the agent's one `Resizer`, for at most a second**, and answers `503` with `Retry-After: 1` past that; the page keeps the image it has, fetches one thumbnail at a time, and asks for the newest picture on a later redraw. Before that, a thumbnail waited 38.9 s behind the picture requests' resizes and the image fell further behind its filename with every picture. A photograph evicted since keeps its caption and loses its picture.

**Photos photographs had no name to show.** A card's identifier is a `PHAsset` identifier, so every line that named one said `C3D4…/L0/001`. The name was **first built as a PhotoKit lookup made by the dashboard while the page was open**, remembered one photograph at a time. It lasted one slice: Syd then asked for the name in the logs and in the app as well, and a lookup at serve time would have put a PhotoKit call of up to ten seconds inside a picture request. **It was replaced by migration 12**, `photo.original_filename`, written when the original is fetched, and the lookup and its memo were deleted.

- **The name is the `.photo` resource's, not the fetched one's.** What is written to the cache is `.fullSizePhoto` when there is one, and on every edited photograph that is called `FullSizeRender.heic`.
- **A photograph cached before migration 12 is named by its identifier until it is fetched again.** Nothing backfills it.
- **The identifier is kept, and the name added.** Log lines read `IMG_0042.HEIC (C3D4…/L0/001)`, because the name is what a person recognises and the identifier is what `pgr_ctl` and the database answer to. A folder photograph's identifier is already its path, and its lines are unchanged.
- **The source is named beside its row id**, `source 6 (Photos › Trips › Holiday)`, from `Source.spokenName` in `PhotosGoRoundAgentAPI` so the agent, the page, and a client all say the same thing. The dashboard takes the source's name at the moment of serving, so a source removed since keeps the name it was served under.
- **A client reads them as `X-PGR-Name` and `X-PGR-Source-Name`**, percent-encoded, and `ServedPicture` decodes them into `name` and `sourceName`. **The header's name has no extension**, since what goes out is in the format `Accept` chose; the logs and the page keep it. Nothing in the app draws them yet.
- **The served record in the unified log carries both, public.** See *Logging*.

### The error record

**Everything the agent reports as an error is recorded, one row per kind.** Every red console line and every error-level log record, in `AgentErrors`, shown newest first with a count, when it was first and last seen, and the most recent full message.

**Grouped by kind because the first design did not survive the code.** The design agreed was to collapse identical messages. Reading the sites first showed that almost no message repeats: a dropped card carries the queue depth, a failed request's line carries its latency, a timeout names the photograph. Keyed on text, the record would have been a scrolling log. So each reporting site names a short fixed kind — `cache.timed-out.source-6`, `serve.library-unavailable` — and the row counts the kind while keeping the latest words to read. A red line nobody classified is grouped by its exact text, so nothing new goes unrecorded.

- **A kind about one source ends in its row id**, because a source that keeps failing is what somebody opening this page is looking for.
- **An event reported both ways is recorded once.** A failed request's red line is left unrecorded, since the error logged where the failure happened records it; a photograph retired by a render failure is recorded as `serve.photo-retired` and not also as `serve.render-failed`; the listener's failure is recorded by its alert, whose words its log record repeats.
- **A disabled source is red at launch and is not an error**, so it is not recorded; an unavailable one is.
- **At most a hundred kinds**, the error seen longest ago giving way — bounded memory against a flood of unclassified lines. Since 2026-09-13 a standing condition gives way only when no other row is left.
- **Recording happens in the agent only.** `RunCommand.run` starts it and attaches `Console.recordAlerts`. `pgr_ctl`, the app, and the screensaver log the same kit errors and keep them nowhere; the wallpaper's three errors, which run in the app, are not recorded at all.
- **The error text did not change.** Every error-level record these sites replaced already marked each of its values `.public`, so `Logger.error(kind:_:into:)` logs the same words it was logging; the difference is that they are a `String` the record can keep.

**Errors leave when they stop, since 2026-09-13.** Syd: "if an error clears after a minute, remove it from that panel". Until then every row stayed for the whole run, and the panel said *since launch*; it is now *Agent errors*.

- **An error leaves a minute after it last happened.** Happening again restarts the minute; happening after it has left is a new row, counted from one.
- **A standing condition stays until it clears.** Asked when the one-minute rule was put to him against the conditions it would have got wrong — Syd: "keep standing conditions until they clear". Three are standing:
  - `source.unavailable`, **recorded at every refresh that finds the source unavailable and cleared by the first that does not.** It was recorded on the transition alone, and still only the transition is red on the console; heard only at the transition, a source already unavailable when the agent launched would never have appeared, and one that went away would have left after a minute.
  - `source.empty`, cleared by the first scan that finds photographs or cannot reach the source. It is reported every scan, so under the minute rule it would have shown for one minute in five.
  - `source.paused`, standing until its pause ends, the time the bench gave it. The pause has an end, so nothing has to clear it.
- **A removed source's standing conditions are cleared with it**, in `SourceStore.remove(id:)`, since nothing will ever report it available or not empty again.
- **So are a disabled source's, decided 2026-09-13.** Disabled sources are not refreshed, so a condition recorded before the source was disabled would have stood until it was re-enabled or removed; it was built that way first and put to Syd, who said to clear them when a source is disabled. Re-enabled, its next refresh finds them again if they still hold.
  - **Cleared in two places, because one would miss `pgr_ctl`.** `SourceStore.setEnabled` clears them when the agent disables a source — from the app, or reconciling after a `defaults write`. `pgr_ctl` disables by reconciling in its own process, against its own error record, so when the agent next reconciles the row is already disabled and `setEnabled` never runs there. Every refresh pass therefore also clears the conditions of the disabled sources it skips, through `Reporter.skipped`.
- **A standing row says how long**, "standing since", and its end time when it has one; an event says how often and how lately. `firstSeen` is when this run first found the condition, not when it began.

**Failed fetches were not recorded at all, and are now `cache.fetch-failed`.** Syd, the same day, having seen 125 in the fetch panel: he wanted the error messages for them in the errors panel.

- **Why they were missing**: a failed fetch's console line is deliberately not red — a volume that is not mounted is the ordinary shape of a library on removable storage — and only red lines were recorded. Timeouts were, and so was a fetch that landed and could not be kept.
- **Every way a fetch comes to nothing now has words.** Several answered a bare `false` — the source disabled or gone, no provider, the volume at its floor, the photograph gone from the library — and were counted as failed with nothing said anywhere. `PhotoCache.fetch` answers `FetchAnswer`, `.landed` or `.failed(because:)`, and says the reason on the console; a provider's error gains that the source confirmed the photograph gone, when it did.
- **Recorded by the fetch lane in `RunCommand`, not where the fetch failed.** Only the lane knows whether anybody was still waiting: a fetch given up on is already `cache.timed-out`, and recording its later failure too would have made one fetch two rows. So each `cache.fetch-failed` is one of the fetches counted in `fetchLookups.failed`, and nothing else is.
- **`cache.could-not-keep` went into it.** That failure was recorded where it happened and would now have been recorded twice; it is logged there and recorded by the lane like the rest.

### What this revised, elsewhere in this document

- *Logging* said photo filenames and album names stay private. The served record now carries both publicly, at Syd's direction; and the queue's lines had been logged public whole all along.
- *Known shortcomings* item 8 asked for `X-PGR-Name` as the leaf name with its extension removed. It was built as the whole path inside the folder with the extension kept; Syd revised the item to the path and had the extension stripped. See the item.
- *Known shortcomings* item 9 asked for a logger behind a seam a test can read. Errors now have one, and nothing else does.
- *The Mac app as instrument panel* put a cache inspector — resident count against the cap, bytes on disk — in the app, as a later panel. The numbers arrived in the agent's page instead, without the forced-eviction button.
- *Phase 3* says diagnostic panels are not Phase 3 work. This one is an agent page rather than an app panel, and arrived there anyway.

## The Mac app as instrument panel

**In Phase 3 the app is deliberately almost nothing.** A window, a photo in it sized to fit, the pan, a timer, and standard full-screen support — the green button and `toggleFullScreen:`, no bespoke presentation layer. That keeps the milestone small and keeps the app honest: it is a *consumer*, and consumers display cards.

**It does manage sources, and that is a reversal of what this section said.** The original text — "it manages no sources and exposes no settings, because `pgr_ctl` shipped one phase earlier and already does both" — did not weigh that `pgr_ctl` never ships, which makes it no answer at all for anybody who is not the author. A Settings panel for sources arrives here; every other verb stays in the rig. See `MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md`. Since then Settings has gained the *Also set wallpapers* checkbox, and the About box links the agent's dashboard. *The checkbox went on 2026-09-16 with the app's wallpaper loop; Settings keeps the wallpaper's *Shuffle All* pop-up, which times the wallpaper extension.*

Full screen is worth more than it looks. A full-screen window showing one photo, fit, slowly panning, is visually the same thing the screensaver will be. Every piece of that behavior — the axis choice, the pan speed and easing, the cross-fade, the black bars, the bouncing empty state — gets built and tuned here, in a normal app, with a debugger attached and print statements that work. Phase 6 then has to solve exactly one new problem, which is the sandbox, rather than solving the sandbox and the visual design at the same time.

**Of that list, only the fit and the black bars were built.** `AspectFit` is in `PhotosGoRoundDisplay` and the window uses it; `Pan` is in there beside it, tested, with no callers anywhere in the project; the cross-fade was never started, and the bouncing empty state waited until 2026-09-09, when it was built in `PhotosGoRoundDisplay` for the window and the saver together. The rehearsal did not happen, and Phase 6 arrived at the sandbox with the visual design still ahead of it rather than behind it. **The argument above is not wrong and is worth keeping** — it is why the 2026-09-07 decision splits the saver's v1 into the picture now and the motion later, in the window, where this section always said it belonged.

**The diagnostic surface comes later, and grows one panel at a time.** Every subsequent surface depends on mechanisms that are miserable to debug in their eventual home — a widget you cannot attach a debugger to, a screensaver inside someone else's sandboxed process, a `BGProcessingTask` that fires when it feels like it. Each of those is easier to exercise in a window first, so each phase that needs a panel adds it then. What that eventually amounts to:

- **A deck inspector.** The next *n* cards in order, each photo's deal ordinal, shuffle key, last-shown time, and cache state. Most deck bugs are instantly obvious when you can see the ordering and instantly invisible when you cannot.
- **Consumer simulation.** Spin up two, three, five consumers at configurable rates and watch the queue drain and refill. This is how the shared-queue contention story gets tested — the "screensaver at one photo per ten seconds starves the wallpaper" scenario is a slider in this app long before there is a screensaver.
- **A cache inspector.** Resident count against the cap, bytes on disk, what is materialized versus referenced, and a forced-eviction button. This is also where the cache-cap measurement gets run, rather than in a throwaway script. **Arrived elsewhere, 2026-09-12**: the agent's dashboard shows the resident count and bytes against the ceiling, without the forced-eviction button, and the cache-cap measurement was cancelled on 2026-09-06.
- **Spike runners.** Each phase's spike as a menu item that reports pass or fail with the relevant log output — the App Group container resolution check, the `PHAssetResourceManager` originals check. The screensaver sandbox spike is the one exception that genuinely cannot run here, since the whole question is what happens inside a different process.
- **A Darwin notification monitor.** A list of the notification topics with a timestamp for each firing, plus buttons to post them by hand. When the agent arrives in Phase 4 and something does not update, this is what tells you whether the doorbell rang.

None of this ships to a user, and none of it needs to be pretty. It should be behind a debug menu or a separate window, built with whatever SwiftUI is quickest, and it should be allowed to look like a diagnostic tool rather than a product.

The one discipline worth keeping: the harness must drive the kit through the same public API the real surfaces use. The moment it reaches past that API to poke the database directly, it stops being a test of anything.

## Logging

The server — and the backend half of the iOS app — logs structurally, through Apple's unified logging and nothing else. `OSLog`/`Logger`, subsystem `com.sydpolk.photosgoround` — `….tests` for a test run — one category per subsystem: `sql`, `deck`, `cache`, `sources`, `photos`, `prefs`, `wallpaper`, `saver`, `widget`, with signposts under `intervals`. `Log.saver` and `Log.widget` are declared and unused: the saver declares a `Logger` of its own, and there is no widget yet.

**Nothing is shipped anywhere.** No crash reporter, no analytics, no log upload, no telemetry endpoint, no third-party SDK — which also keeps the dependency ledger at zero. If this ever becomes popular enough to justify collecting anything, that is a decision to spend money and time on later, from a position of knowing it matters. Until then, logs live on the machine that produced them and are read with Console or `log show`.

**Unified logging is not merely the zero-dependency option, it is the only one that works everywhere we run.** A hand-rolled file logger would fail in exactly the places debugging is hardest: the screensaver inside `legacyScreenSaver`'s sandbox may not be able to write a log file at all, and a widget extension has neither a writable location we control nor a lifetime long enough to flush one. `os_log` crosses those boundaries because the system owns the transport. Every process writes to the same place and `pgr_ctl` can read all of it.

Details that decide whether the logs are useful a week later:

- **Level determines persistence, so choose deliberately.** `.debug` is memory-only and gone by the time you look; `.info` persists only when the subsystem is being actively collected. State transitions worth reconstructing after the fact — source became unavailable, cache cleared, library switch detected, preference changed, wallpaper reasserted — must be `.notice` or higher, or they will not be there.
- **Privacy annotations are on by default, and that is correct here.** Interpolated values are redacted as `<private>` unless marked `.public`. File paths, photo filenames, and album names are the user's business and stay private. Structural values — source ids, counts, durations, error codes, deal ordinals — are marked public, because a log full of `<private>` is not a log. **Amended 2026-09-12:** the agent's record of a served picture carries the photograph's name and its source's name publicly, at Syd's direction, because an installed agent's unified log is the only log it has. The queue's `SERVE:`, `CACHE:`, and `DEAL:` lines were already logged public whole, names included, so this bullet had not been true of them.
- **Errors are also recorded in memory, by kind, for the dashboard**, kept a minute after they stop or, for a standing condition, until it clears. In the agent only; see *The error record*.
- **Structured means fields, not prose.** Consistent event names with consistent keys, so `log show --predicate` can filter on them. "Materialized 10 photos in 4.2s for source 3" is a sentence; the same thing with stable keys is queryable.
- **`OSSignposter` for intervals**, not log lines: decode-to-display time, fetch duration, refresh duration, serve latency. These are the numbers the Phase 2 measurements need, and signposts make them readable in Instruments without building a benchmark harness. **Only two are built**: `migration` and `refresh`. Decode, fetch, and serve are not signposted; the request log carries serve latency instead.
- **`pgr_ctl log`** wraps `log show --predicate 'subsystem == "com.sydpolk.photosgoround"'` with sensible defaults and a `--follow` mode, because nobody should have to remember predicate syntax to see what the server is doing.
- **The queue and its fetcher narrate themselves, under four prefixes** — two queues until 2026-09-05, when the queue of pictures to cache went — so a console with everything interleaved stays readable and any one stream can be filtered out: `DEAL:` for a card going onto the queue of pictures to show, `SERVE:` for what that queue then decided about one, `CACHE:` for anything written to the cache, `CONFIG:` for a setting that changed underneath them. Dealing earns its own prefix because it happens in bursts of twenty while serving happens one at a time, and a burst is noise in the middle of reading a decision.
- **Every line about a queue carries that queue's depth**, so a size cannot change without saying so. This was added after an evening of inferring queue depth from the gaps between other lines, and it is worth the width: the queue moves on almost every request — a card taken, another dropped, one dealt behind it — and a depth printed only when something is *added* leaves the reader doing arithmetic. The exceptions are the lines that touch neither queue. **Corrected 2026-09-12: not every line carries a depth, and the backlog line is gone.** `DEAL:` lines, each `SERVE:` line about a card, and `CACHE: … dropped from the deck` carry it; `SERVE: nothing to show` carries how many cards it walked instead; and the fetch lines — `fetching`, `already here`, `original cached`, `failed`, `did not answer` — and `source … paused` carry none, since the fetcher changes no depth. The backlog that turned photographs away went with look-ahead, and the kept resize with the resize cache on 2026-09-06.
- ~~**Say which bytes went out.**~~ A served line distinguished the original from a kept resize, because otherwise there was no way to tell from a console whether the renderings were earning their disk — a `kept` with no matching `reused` is half a story. **It answered that question on 2026-09-06 and the resize cache lost**, so there is one kind of bytes left and the line says the photograph is here. What survives is the other half: it carries the reason when a source could not confirm a photograph and the copy we hold went out anyway, which is the one moment the deleted-photo guarantee is knowingly relaxed.

Because the logs are never collected, they have to be self-sufficient on the machine. That argues for logging the *reason* alongside every state change rather than logging that it happened and hoping the cause is inferable from what came before.

## Testing strategy

`PhotosGoRoundKit` is where the logic lives, so that is where the tests live. The deck algorithm is pure and testable against an in-memory database: at fraction 1.0, assert that a thousand deals across a hundred photos produce exactly ten showings each with no repeat inside any hundred-deal stretch; at lower fractions, assert no repeat inside the window and report the gap distribution. The cache is testable with a folder of synthetic files: assert that eviction holds the byte ceiling and never empties the cache, that a picture deleted from a reachable source is never served, and that an unreachable source keeps serving from cache. The source providers get integration tests behind a protocol so folder sources test for real and Photos tests against a fixture library.

Above the unit tests sit three layers, each catching what the one below cannot:

- **`pgr_ctl` and `curl`** for anything scriptable, statistical, or concurrent — shuffle distribution over fifty thousand draws, cache-budget sweeps, and several requests at once to prove the queue pop actually serialises.
- **A caveat learned the hard way about where that line falls.** Everything below the HTTP layer can be right while the layer itself is wrong: the byte store's tests passed in full while the endpoint missed its cache on every single request, because it was building a fresh index per request and no test drove `route` twice. A component tested through the seam beneath it is not tested. Where a decision only exists at the wiring — a cache lookup, a header, a skip-and-continue — there has to be a test that goes in the front door. These are assertions a test suite can run in CI as easily as a person can run them by hand.
- **The Mac app's instrument panel** for anything visual or timing-dependent — deck ordering seen at a glance, simulated consumers at different rates, Darwin notifications observed as they fire. **Not built**: there is no instrument panel; the window itself and the agent's dashboard are what exist.
- **Per-phase spikes and manual verification** for what neither can reach: wallpaper application, the saver's sandbox behavior, widget timeline budgets.

That asymmetry is a good reason to keep as much behavior as possible inside the package, where the cheapest layer can reach it.

### A test that writes preferences names its suite by a path

Worth recording because two obvious fixes did not work and the third is a one-line change. Tests that touch preferences each build a throwaway `UserDefaults` suite so they never write into the real domain, and tear it down afterwards. Named the obvious way — a dotted domain under the test prefix — they left a plist in `~/Library/Preferences` on nearly every run, five hundred of them before anyone counted.

The reason is that a dotted domain lives in a directory `cfprefsd` owns and writes on its own schedule, including *after* the test process has exited. Nothing inside the process can win that race. Two rounds of trying: a sweep at the *start* of each run that cleared what the previous one left, bounding the leak at one run's worth; then a wrapper script around `swift test` that polled `defaults delete` until the daemon went quiet, on the theory that a process which outlives the test process can wait the race out. Measured on 2026-09-02, both teardown styles a dotted domain allows lost anyway: a file removed after the last write came back, and so did one torn down with `removePersistentDomain`, which is a write that sets the domain to empty and leaves the daemon holding it as pending state.

**The fix is to stop putting the file where the daemon owns it.** `UserDefaults(suiteName:)` accepts an absolute path — `defaults read /path/to/file` is the same feature, as old as the tool — and stores the domain at `<path>.plist`. Every scratch suite is now a path under one per-process directory in the temp folder, which an `atexit` hook removes. Removing a directory the process owns is a teardown the daemon does not undo: forty domains with writes still in flight at exit, half of them also torn down with `removePersistentDomain`, and nothing came back in two minutes. A full run leaves zero files in either place, checked a minute later. `Shared/Tests/Support/ScratchPreferences.swift` is the whole of it; a hygiene test fails the next run if a dotted scratch domain ever appears in `~/Library/Preferences` again, which can only mean a test named its own suite instead of asking for one. The sweep and the wrapper script are gone.

## The agent: registration and permissions

**Everything is an Xcode target as of 2026-09-08, and the reason is debugging rather than building.** The app, its tests, the screensaver, the screensaver spike, the agent, and `pgr_ctl` are all targets in `Photos-Go-Round.xcodeproj` — "by having xcode targets I can debug things in Xcode if needed", and a `.saver` inside someone else's host and a headless agent are both things worth being able to attach to. The package is untouched and `swift test` is still the test story: the executables' targets read straight out of `MacOS/Agent/Sources` and `MacOS/Tools/pgr_ctl/Sources` through synchronized folders, so there is one copy of every source and two ways to build it. `Console` became a library product because an Xcode target can link a package's products and cannot see a bare target.

**The scripts stay, and their job is deployment.** Copying a `.saver` into `~/Library/Screen Savers`, clearing the caches that otherwise run the previous build, writing the LaunchAgent plist, running the agent where its stdout is readable — none of that is Xcode's. The one real hazard of two build systems showed up immediately and is recorded in `Screensaver Plan.md`, *Two build systems over one set of sources*: `SWIFT_APPROACHABLE_CONCURRENCY` was set on an Xcode target and not in the package, which made the same file compile under different isolation rules and fail on one side only.

Package it as an app bundle with `LSUIElement = true` — no Dock icon, no menu bar presence unless we choose one — living in `Contents/Library/LoginItems/` inside the main app, with its LaunchAgent plist in `Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/`. The config app registers it with `SMAppService.agent(plistName:)`, which is the modern replacement for hand-installing plists in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` and for the deprecated `SMLoginItemSetEnabled`. The user can then see and disable it in System Settings → General → Login Items, which is the behavior people expect.

**Corrected 2026-09-10: a per-user plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, not `SMAppService`.** Syd: "the agent MUST be installed in ~/Library/LaunchAgents; this needs to support multiple users on the same machine" — "at least the database and plist", and "the binary stays in the app bundle." Each user gets a plist whose `ProgramArguments` points into the one app bundle, and a database and container of their own. A plist there still appears in Login Items, under *Allow in the Background*. *Checked 2026-09-23 with `sfltool dumpbtm`:* it is there, enabled and allowed, but listed under the signing certificate's name, *Sydney Polk*, not the app's. `AssociatedBundleIdentifiers` naming `com.sydpolk.photosgoround` was added the same day; macOS records it and still files the agent under *Sydney Polk*, across a logout, for a build signed with an Apple Development certificate. ~~Whether a Developer ID build, or only `SMAppService`, would put it under Photos-Go-Round is not known.~~ **Answered 2026-09-23 by the first notarized Release: a Developer ID build is listed as *Photos-Go-Round.app*, running in background**, so `AssociatedBundleIdentifiers` is enough and `SMAppService` is not needed for it. macOS's *App Background Activity* notice at first install changed with it: Apple Development builds had always raised it naming "Sydney Polk" (Syd); this one names "Photos-Go-Round.app". **Its `ProcessType` is `Adaptive`, since 2026-09-17** — `Background` throttles the job's disk I/O, and this one reads the disk to answer somebody waiting on a picture; see `Agent Performance Overhaul.md`, *Most of the restart was an I/O throttle, not the walk*. The paragraph above is kept because it is the reasoning this replaced; see `Wallpaper Plan.md`, *How wallpaper binaries are made on macOS*. **Decided and not built, as of 2026-09-12**: nothing in the app installs a plist yet, and `pgr_ctl register` and `Scripts/make-agent-bundle.sh` still take the `SMAppService` route.

A bundle rather than a bare executable matters for TCC: the Photos permission prompt needs a bundle identifier and an `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, and the grant is recorded against the code signature. Developer ID signing plus notarization keeps that grant stable across updates.

`KeepAlive` with `SuccessfulExit = false` so it restarts on crash; `RunAtLoad` true. The agent should also handle being launched before the user has granted Photos access — request, and if denied, run with folder sources only rather than dying.

## Talking to the subsystems we do control

**Superseded by *The service is the interface* and *The database is private to the service*; corrected 2026-08-24, having survived both revision lists.** The pairing below was the design until Phase 1.5 — shared state in SQLite that every one of our processes opened directly, a Darwin notification as the doorbell — and what survives of it is exactly the control channel: preferences remain the durable store that `defaults write` and `pgr_ctl` reach with nothing running, a payload-free notification still says *go look*, and both flow one direction — from the outside world to the service, never back. `pgr_ctl` keeps its direct database access because it is the rig, not a client.

Everything else moved to HTTP. The config app, the widgets, and every other surface ask the service for pictures and for facts, and never open the database or the cache; there is a local HTTP server precisely because of it, and XPC never arrived. What degrades well degrades the same way it did: with the agent stopped, `pgr_ctl` and `defaults write` still configure the library and the agent picks the changes up when it starts — and a *client* with no agent has nothing to do anyway, which is argued under *Requiring the agent is not a cost*.

Worth noting the fallback if all three fail: ship the screensaver as a full-screen borderless window from an ordinary app, triggered by an idle timer, rather than as a `.saver` bundle. That loses integration with System Settings and with the lock screen, and I would treat it as a last resort. **Not needed. A real `.saver` reached the agent from inside `legacyScreenSaver` on 2026-09-07**, so this stays written down for the next platform release that takes the grant away rather than as a live option.

## Wallpaper mechanics and their limits

`NSWorkspace.shared.setDesktopImageURL(_:for:options:)` takes an `NSScreen`, so per-display wallpaper is straightforward, and the options dictionary carries fill mode and background color — that is the "control how it was displayed" you asked for. Unsandboxed, there is no entitlement problem.

**Planned in `Wallpaper Plan.md`, 2026-09-10, which settles several points in this section.** The wallpaper is a client — the Mac app runs it first, then a binary of its own — so wherever this section says *the agent* re-applies or reasserts, read *whatever runs the wallpaper*. The background colour is not ours to set: the space around the photograph is the fill colour chosen in System Settings. The files the desktop points at live in `~/Library/Application Support/com.sydpolk.photogoround.wallpaper.{dev|prod}/` *(no longer: the app's loop that wrote them was removed 2026-09-16, and the extension keeps only its last picture, in its own container — `Wallpaper Plan.md`, The app's loop, removed)*, never in the agent's container — "the app should not need to see the agent's container." And it runs only while the app's *Also set wallpapers* checkbox is ticked. **As built, 2026-09-12**, the app's wallpaper always uses the development deployment — the `.dev` domain and directory, and the development agent — because the app asks for `.development` throughout until *The app brings its own agent* decides otherwise. **Superseded 2026-09-16:** the app's loop is removed; the wallpaper is an ExtensionKit extension on `com.apple.wallpaper`, chosen in System Settings, which draws into surfaces `WallpaperAgent` hands it rather than setting files — so `setDesktopImageURL`, the files, the per-Space hole and the reverting all belong to the removed loop. `Wallpaper Plan.md`, *The real extension, inside the app* and *The app's loop, removed*.

Two limitations to plan around. First, the call sets the wallpaper for the *current* Space on that screen only; if you use multiple Spaces, the others keep whatever they had until you visit them. There is no public API to enumerate Spaces, so the practical mitigation is for the agent to re-apply on `NSWorkspace.activeSpaceDidChangeNotification`.

### Wallpaper is asserted continuously, never set once

Second, and more seriously: macOS reverts wallpaper on its own. The observed behavior on the current setup is that the desktop drops back to the stock Golden Gate image at random, stays there a while, and later starts working again — with no user action involved. Whatever the cause (a wallpaper agent losing its state, a dynamic-wallpaper interaction, a display reconfiguration racing login), we cannot prevent it and should not try to diagnose it. We can simply refuse to lose.

So the wallpaper consumer does not set an image and consider the job done. It owns an invariant — *this screen should currently be showing this file* — and enforces it:

- **Verify, then correct.** `NSWorkspace.shared.desktopImageURL(for:)` returns what the system believes is current. Compare it against what we last set for that screen; if it does not match and we did not change it, set it again. This is a cheap call and can run on a modest interval — every minute or two costs nothing.
- **Reassert on every event that plausibly disturbs it:** wake from sleep, `NSApplication.didChangeScreenParametersNotification`, `NSWorkspace.activeSpaceDidChangeNotification`, session activation, and agent launch. **2026-09-10:** the first version puts each display's stored file back at its own launch and on display and Space changes; checking for and correcting macOS's own reversions is later work. See `Wallpaper Plan.md`, *Displays and Spaces*.
- **Do not fight the user.** If someone deliberately sets a wallpaper through System Settings, hammering it back is obnoxious. The distinction is that a user change is a change to something *other* than the Golden Gate default we never chose — a reasonable heuristic is to reassert only when the current image is neither ours nor one the user set within the app, and to expose a "pause wallpaper" control so there is an obvious way to stop us.
- **Log the corrections.** If the reversion turns out to have a pattern, the log is what reveals it. If it is genuinely random, the log is what proves the correction is working.

Scheduling the *rotation* is separate and simpler: an interval from preferences, a `DispatchSourceTimer` that checks wall-clock rather than counting ticks so it survives sleep, and an immediate deal on wake if the interval elapsed while the machine was out. **Refined 2026-09-10, and revised since: a preference, thirty minutes by default** — `intervalSeconds` in the wallpaper's own domain, clamped between ten seconds and seven days and re-read every round, with the loop checking back at least every thirty seconds so a change is noticed. The default was sixty seconds from 2026-09-10 and went back to thirty minutes on 2026-09-13, when the development domain's value was set to thirty minutes too; what follows was written around the first thirty minutes. Each display's change time is stored in the wallpaper's own preference domain, `com.sydpolk.photosgoround[.debug|.claude].wallpaper` *(`com.sydpolk.photogoround.wallpaper.{dev|prod}` until 2026-09-24)*, and a display changes only when its stored time is thirty minutes old — at launch too: "the image should not be changed before the time interval … even if the binary was just started up." A cancellable task that works out the next due time replaces the `DispatchSourceTimer`, with the same wake behaviour.

## Swift everywhere, including the screensaver

The Xcode screensaver template generates Objective-C, which is a fact about the template rather than about screensavers. `ScreenSaverView` is an Objective-C class, but subclassing it from Swift is entirely ordinary — delete the template's `.m` and `.h`, add a Swift file, and write the saver in Swift like anything else. There is no Objective-C anywhere in this project.

Three specific things make a Swift `.saver` fail, and all three are configuration rather than code. They are worth writing down because the failure mode in every case is the same and is maximally unhelpful: the screensaver silently does not appear in System Settings, with no error anywhere.

- **The principal class name must survive Swift name mangling.** A Swift class compiles to a mangled symbol like `_TtC15PhotoGoRoundSaver18PGRScreenSaverView`, which is not what you put in `Info.plist`. Annotate the class `@objc(PGRScreenSaverView)` to give it a stable Objective-C runtime name, and set `NSPrincipalClass` to exactly that string. This one accounts for most "my Swift screensaver doesn't show up" reports.
- **The bundle must be a `.saver`, not a `.bundle`.** The wrapper extension is a build setting, and the target must be a bundle target rather than a framework or app target.
- **The two required initializers must both exist.** `init?(frame:isPreview:)` is the one you write; `init?(coder:)` must also be present because the class is instantiated through the Objective-C runtime.

The rest of the plan is Swift and SwiftUI throughout. A few of the APIs involved are C rather than Objective-C — `sqlite3_*`, and libnotify's `notify_post` and `notify_register_dispatch` for cross-process signalling — which means some `UnsafePointer` handling at those two boundaries, wrapped once and never touched again. That is not Objective-C and does not require knowing any.

That earlier project was deleted on sight of the `.m` files, so there is nothing to salvage from it and no prior observation of what a saver can read from disk. The Phase 6 sandbox spike stands as the sole source of that answer. It is a stub saver and an afternoon, and nothing stops it being run early — out of order, ahead of the phases before it — if the uncertainty starts to feel expensive.

## The screensaver sandbox problem

This is the largest technical risk in the plan, and the reason Phase 6 opens with a spike rather than with code.

Modern macOS does not run `.saver` bundles in a process of their own. It loads them into `legacyScreenSaver`, an Apple-provided host that is itself sandboxed. Our code inherits that sandbox. So the saver almost certainly cannot open `~/Library/Application Support/Photo-Go-Round/cache/`, no matter that the user owns both.

**Answered 2026-09-07, and most of it without running anything.** The host's entitlements are readable on disk — `codesign -d --entitlements -` against `/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/PlugIns/legacyScreenSaver.appex` — and they settle four of the five options before a spike starts:

- `com.apple.security.network.client` is **granted**, so option 3 works. It was ranked third here and marked unverified.
- `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.files.absolute-path.read-only` is `/`, so **option 1 was never needed**: the saver can already read the real store where it lives, with no container relocation and no Apple implementation detail to depend on. It cannot *write* it — SQLite has to create and lock `-wal` and `-shm` — which is exactly why a read grant is no substitute for the service.
- Option 4 needs a writable path, and the write side is the half that is missing. Ranked last, and right.
- `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.mach-lookup.global-name` names four Apple services and nothing else, so **XPC is impossible rather than untested.** There is no version of it that works, and it can be struck rather than deferred.
- `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` is set, so the host loads a bundle we signed ourselves. Ad-hoc is enough to develop against.

A stub `.saver` then confirmed the network half on the machine. What the entitlements could not settle is a question this section does not contain: the saver can *reach* the agent and cannot *find* it, because the port is published into a preference domain the sandbox will not hand over. That half is written up in `Screensaver Plan.md`.

**The four options below are kept as they stood.** The ladder is the right way to think about the next sandboxed surface — the Phase 8 widget inherits the same problem — and the reasoning is worth more than the conclusion it reached.

The options, in your order of preference:

1. **Direct database and file access, via the host's container.** The unsandboxed agent writes the database and cache to `~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ScreenSaver.Engine.legacyScreenSaver/Data/Library/Application Support/Photo-Go-Round/`. From inside the sandbox that path *is* `~/Library/Application Support/Photo-Go-Round/`, so the saver opens it as ordinary local storage — same SQLite calls as everything else, no protocol, no serialization, no server. It is ugly in exactly one way: the container path is an Apple implementation detail that could change under us. Cheapest to test and by far the best outcome, so it goes first.
2. **Darwin notifications.** These almost certainly cross the sandbox — `notify_post` and `notify_register_dispatch` are permitted in most profiles — but they are not an alternative to option 1, because **a Darwin notification carries no payload**. It is a name and nothing else. That makes it a doorbell, not a transport: it can tell the saver "the deck changed, go look," but the looking still has to happen through the database. So options 1 and 2 compose rather than compete, and option 2 alone cannot carry the screensaver.
3. **Localhost HTTP.** The agent binds an HTTP server to `127.0.0.1` on an ephemeral port, publishing the port and a per-launch bearer token through a file the saver can read; the saver fetches images and posts deck advances over it. This works only if `legacyScreenSaver`'s sandbox grants outbound network access, which is unverified. The token matters because any local process can otherwise reach that port.
4. **Unix domain sockets.** Ranked last, and correctly so, but for a sharper reason than general distaste: a Unix socket is a file on disk, so it needs both `network-outbound` permission *and* a path the sandbox permits. That is strictly a superset of what option 1 needs. If the sandbox lets us place a socket somewhere the saver can open it, it would have let us put the database there instead — and the database is simpler. Unix sockets can only ever be the answer in the narrow case where file *reads* are permitted but SQLite's write locking is not, which is unlikely enough not to plan around.

**XPC is absent from your list.** It is the Apple-idiomatic answer — a global Mach service in the agent's LaunchAgent plist, `NSXPCConnection` from the saver — and architecturally the cleanest of the lot. It is also the one with no workaround if it fails: `legacyScreenSaver`'s sandbox may simply deny `mach-lookup` for names it does not recognize, and there is nothing to be done about that from our side. Given it sits below your top two in appeal and above HTTP in cleanliness, the plan tests it only if 1 fails, and treats it as an alternative to 3 rather than a replacement for it. Say if you would rather drop it entirely.

**The fallback if nothing works: a consumption journal.** The saver reads the head of the queue without removing it, appends what it showed to a file in its own container, and the agent applies those removals to the real queue. Eventually consistent rather than atomic, so two savers on two displays could briefly show the same picture — acceptable, and far cheaper than the alternative. **Moot, and it would have worked:** the saver can write inside its own container and the unsandboxed agent can read it. Nothing needs it, because option 3 is granted.

The spike is small: a stub `.saver` that tries each in order and logs results, installed and run for real. A day at most, and it determines the shape of Phase 6. **It took an afternoon and it did not try each in order** — reading the entitlements first meant the stub had one rung to confirm and one question to ask that none of the rungs covered. *"Phase 5" stood here until 2026-09-07 and was a typo for Phase 6.*

## Screensaver v1: one photo, fit, with a slow pan

The first layout is deliberately the simplest one that looks good: a single photo at a time, sized to fit the display, and when the photo's aspect ratio does not match the display's, a slow pan back and forth along the mismatched axis instead of a static image sitting in dead black.

**The pan and the cross-fade are not in the first build; decided 2026-09-07.** What ships first is the photograph, fit, on black — visually what the app window does today — as a proof that a saver can be fed by the agent at all. Everything else in this section is deferred rather than dropped, and comes back as a phase of its own once there is something to apply it to. The reason is that motion is tuned by eye over many iterations, and the inside of `legacyScreenSaver` is the worst place on the machine to iterate: no debugger, a host process we do not own, and a build-install-select-invoke cycle for every adjustment. Sequencing the picture first also means the sandbox and the visual design are never being debugged at the same time, which is the same argument *The Mac app as instrument panel* makes for the window.

**Sizing is "shrink or expand, preserving aspect ratio" — aspect fit.** The photo scales up if it is smaller than the display and down if it is larger, until it fits entirely on screen. The whole photo is always visible and nothing is ever cropped. Where the ratios differ there is black, and the pan slides the fitted photo within that black field: the bar migrates from one side to the other and back. This is the one display mode in v1; others come later.

**Choosing the axis.** Compare the photo's aspect ratio to the display's. A photo relatively *wider* than the display fits to the screen's width and leaves black above and below, so it travels up and down; a photo relatively *taller* fits to the height and leaves black at the sides, so it travels left and right. When the two ratios are within a percent or so of each other, there is no bar and nothing to pan, and the photo simply sits there — which is correct. The code should not manufacture motion where none is warranted.

**Travel distance is the bar, and it is often small.** Unlike a fill-and-overflow pan, the distance available here is exactly the letterbox thickness, which for a 3:2 photo on a 16:10 display is only a few percent of the screen. That is a feature — the motion is meant to be barely perceptible, not a ride — but it means the pan should be skipped entirely below some threshold rather than jittering a photo back and forth across twelve points.

**Constant speed, not constant duration.** The pan should move at a fixed rate in screen points per second — somewhere around 10 pt/s, to be tuned by eye — rather than traversing the full overflow in a fixed time. If speed were derived from overflow divided by dwell time, a panorama would streak across the screen while a nearly-square photo would creep, and the inconsistency reads as a glitch. With constant speed, some photos complete their traverse and reverse, and some do not finish; both look intentional.

**Ping-pong with easing.** "Back and forth" means the motion reverses at the extremes rather than jumping. Ease in and out at each reversal — a linear pan that instantly reverses looks mechanical. `CABasicAnimation` with `autoreverses = true`, `repeatCount = .infinity`, and an ease-in-ease-out timing function is exactly this, declaratively.

**Use Core Animation, not `animateOneFrame()`.** `ScreenSaverView` offers a per-frame callback, and it is the wrong tool here. A layer-backed image with a declarative animation runs on the render server, so the pan stays perfectly smooth even while the saver's own thread is busy decoding the next photo or reserving a new hand. Per-frame drawing would stutter at exactly the moments the user is most likely to notice.

**Resolution, and the cost of "expand."** Because the photo only ever fits, the subsampled decode targets the display's pixel dimensions and no more — there is no overflow to cover. The saver asks `CGImageSource` for the screen's long dimension and gets back exactly what it needs.

The "expand" half of the requirement carries a quality caveat worth stating plainly: a 640×480 image scaled up to fill a 6K display's height will look soft, and no amount of interpolation fixes missing detail. The requirement is explicit, so v1 expands anyway. But an upscale cap — refuse to enlarge beyond, say, 2× native and let the small photo sit smaller with more black around it — is an obvious later option, and it belongs in the same settings group as the other display modes.

**Transitions between photos.** A cross-fade, with the incoming photo's pan already in motion underneath, so the arrival does not read as a jump cut into a static frame. Decode and prepare the next photo during the current one's dwell, which the hand makes easy — the next card is already known.

**Black is black.** Any remaining letterbox area is pure black rather than a dark gray, which matters on OLED and on the XDR displays where it is genuinely black. A blurred-and-scaled fill of the photo behind the letterbox is the obvious future alternative and is explicitly not v1.

**Preview mode must not consume the queue.** `ScreenSaverView` is instantiated with `isPreview: true` for the thumbnail in System Settings. That instance must not serve — if it did, idly browsing screensaver settings would consume pictures nobody ever sees, and with a shared queue those are then spent for the wallpaper too. Preview peeks at the queue without draining it, which the queue supports directly. **That last sentence is stale, and the correction matters more than the sentence did.** It was written when a client opened the database and could run whatever query it liked; since *The service is the interface* the agent exposes exactly one picture route, `GET /v1/next`, and serving pops. The queue still supports a peek — the *wire* does not, and a client that never opens the database has no other way in. So preview looked like it needed an answer that does not exist: a photograph shipped inside the bundle, a static card, a new `GET /v1/peek`, or one card spent per visit to the settings pane.

**The paragraph immediately below is wrong, and is kept because the mistake in it is an easy one. Read the correction after it.**

**It needs none of them. Measured 2026-09-08, and this rule turns out to be free.** System Settings does instantiate the principal class with `isPreview: true` — but it creates it at **zero by zero**, lays it out at zero by zero, never calls `draw` on it, and never calls `startAnimation`. A view with no area that is never drawn cannot spend a card whatever it does, and cannot show anything either: the thumbnail in the settings pane is a snapshot the system captured while the saver was genuinely running, which is why it shows a photograph and does not cycle.

So the requirement is met by refusing to serve when `isPreview` is true, which is three lines and costs nothing, and *there is no live preview to be had*. The documented workaround for a preview that never starts — a `Timer` from `init` calling `startAnimation` — is for `FB9835060`, which Apple fixed in Ventura and which is a different fault: there, `init` and `draw` were called and only the start was missed. Starting a zero-area view that is never drawn would spend a card per dwell to render nothing.

**Corrected 2026-09-09. The preview is live, and this rule is not being met.** Everything above about the `isPreview: true` instance is accurate and beside the point: it is a 0x0 probe System Settings uses to ask the class questions. The pane's actual preview is an ordinary **`isPreview: false`** view, in a *different* `legacyScreenSaver` process, which starts, joins the display's loop, and serves cards like any other surface — observed animating and cycling photographs. So browsing the Screen Saver pane spends a card per dwell, and the `isPreview` guard protects nothing, because the view doing the work does not carry the flag.

**What went wrong in the reading is the part worth keeping.** One instance was observed; it was the one whose flag matched the question being asked; nothing checked whether a second process was doing the work. A fact about that instance was taken as a fact about the feature, and the tell — a different pid — was in the log the whole time.

There is no clean way to refuse, either: the preview view is indistinguishable from a genuine one except by frame size, and inferring from that is the same move that caused this. So the requirement above needs a decision rather than an implementation — and it is close to one already made, since relaxing it was called acceptable on 2026-09-08 in exchange for a preview showing real photographs. See `Screensaver Plan.md`, *The preview is live, and it is an ordinary instance*.

**One instance per display, and each is its own consumer.** macOS creates a separate `ScreenSaverView` for every attached screen. Each serves from the same queue, so the displays show different photos simply because serving removes the entry, and each computes its own pan against its own aspect ratio.

**The first sentence is wrong, measured 2026-09-08, and it is worth keeping because the correct-sounding version cost most of a morning.** macOS makes *more* views than there are screens: on a laptop with no external display, no Sidecar and no Universal Control, two `ScreenSaverView`s reported the same display UUID inside one `legacyScreenSaver` process. Left alone they each ran their own picture loop, so one screen drew two cards per dwell out of a shared queue — and a host process that outlives its session kept one of them asking for nineteen minutes with nothing on screen, about 110 photographs.

What survives is the second half: **the consumer is the display.** That is what the deck's `(kind, displayID)` identity already assumed, so the loop is keyed to the display and the views borrow it — one loop, one consumer row, one card per dwell per screen, however many views the host decides to make. A view that arrives while a loop is running joins it and inherits the photograph already up, which removes the black frame at a wake. See `Screensaver Plan.md`, *The host outlives the session*.

**And `window != nil` is not the same question as "the window is on a screen".** `NSWindow.screen` is nil until the window has been placed, so a display identity captured at first layout can be wrong and stay wrong. Resolve it live — and for the view whose window never reports a screen at all, which live resolution cannot help, adopt the machine's sole identified display rather than running a second loop beside it. With two or more displays the guess is ambiguous and is not made.

## The empty state

With no photos at all, the screensaver shows the words "No Photos Available" bouncing around the screen — constant velocity, reflecting off each edge, the way a breakout brick or a DVD logo does.

**Not in the screensaver's first build, and it has been homeless for a while.** The words are built and correct — `Shuffle` produces them, and distinguishes an empty library from an absent agent from a wedged one — but nothing moves them anywhere. `MacOS/Desktop/FEATURES.md` lists *The empty state moves* as the app's to build, "so Phase 6 inherits it"; `Shuffle.swift` parks the bouncing letters as "Phase 6's treatment". **Each document points at the other, and neither has built it.** With motion deferred out of the saver's v1 the gap is now explicit rather than accidental, and it leaves the burn-in argument above unanswered: a static label on an OLED or XDR panel is the hazard this section exists to avoid, and an agent that stops overnight is exactly how somebody gets one. The smallest thing that is not a hazard is repositioning the words once per dwell — no animation, no path, three lines — and that is a stopgap rather than the treatment described here. **Built, and kept deliberately: decided 2026-09-08.** The label wanders once per dwell in the shipping saver even though motion is otherwise deferred, because the hazard is real and the alternative is a still label on an OLED panel all night. **Corrected 2026-09-12: the treatment itself was built on 2026-09-09.** `EmptyStateView` and `BouncePath` in `PhotosGoRoundDisplay` move the words on one `CAKeyframeAnimation` along a closed reflecting path, in the window and the saver alike, and replaced the once-per-dwell stopgap. See `Screensaver Plan.md`, Phase 4.

This is the right call for three reasons beyond it being fun. It is unmistakably *our* screensaver rather than a black screen that looks like a crash or a display asleep. It moves, so it cannot burn in on the OLED and XDR panels where a static centered label would be a genuine hazard over hours. And it appears in the System Settings preview thumbnail too, which means a misconfigured install announces itself at exactly the moment the user is looking at the settings pane.

Implementation notes:

- **Constant velocity, pure reflection.** No gravity, no damping, no acceleration — position advances linearly and the velocity component flips sign at each wall. Speed in points per second so it looks the same on a laptop panel and a 6K display.
- **Avoid degenerate angles.** An initial direction too close to horizontal or vertical traces the same boring line forever. Pick the starting angle randomly from a band away from the axes, roughly 30–60° and its reflections.
- **Core Animation again,** for the same reason as the pan: the motion should not stutter because something else is busy. A `CAKeyframeAnimation` over an analytically-computed reflecting path covering several minutes is simpler and smoother than per-bounce chaining.
- **`CATextLayer` sized relative to the screen,** on the order of an eighth of the width, so it is legible across the whole display range without a hardcoded point size. **As built**: two `CATextLayer`s moving together — the words fitted to 55% of the width and capped at a fifth of the height, a line of what to do beneath at about a third of that size — at 24 points a second. **Changed 2026-09-26: one line, at 80% of the width.** Syd: "No secondary lines of text", and "Size it to fill the image size if the image size is small, like for previews in wallpapers and screensavers." **No preview is small to the code**: the Screen Saver pane's is an 1800-point instance shrunk into the pane, and the Wallpaper pane's is the desktop's picture shrunk, so at 55% the words reached both as thin text nine or ten points high. A rule for views that really are small was built first and reached neither. The lever left was the share everywhere, and Syd chose 80% over leaving it: the words take 80% of the width at every size, still capped at a fifth of the height, which a short line like *Starting…* meets first. The 16-point floor is gone. The rule is `EmptyStateWords`, which the wallpaper's still follows too.

**Three distinct empty states, one treatment.** It is worth distinguishing *no sources configured at all*, *sources configured but they enumerate to nothing* — an emptied folder, an album you deleted — and *photos exist but none are cached yet*, which is the cold-start case and is transient. The bouncing treatment suits all three; only the words differ, and the third should say something like "Loading photos" so a first run does not look broken. Whether to bother with that distinction in v1 is a judgment call I would make in favor of, since the code is the same and the third case is the one a new user hits first. **As built, 2026-09-09**: all three arrive from the agent as one `204` and cannot be told apart, so they all read "No Photos Available", and an agent that is missing or stuck reads "Photo-Go-Round Is Not Running" — each with a line of what to do underneath. **Changed 2026-09-16:** agent trouble reads "Waiting for Photos" with nothing underneath. The line said "Open the Photo-Go-Round application to start it", shown inside that application, and once launchd started the agent at login it was wrong everywhere. Syd: "fix the wording. it's stupid."

**A fix the words needed on the way, 2026-09-26.** `EmptyStateView` laid itself out again only when its size changed, so new words in a window that had not moved were stored and never drawn — Syd's window stayed on *Waiting for Photos* after the agent had answered *no sources* and Settings had opened. The words changing now forces the layout.

**Changed 2026-09-26: two of the three are told apart, by the agent.** The `204` carries `X-PGR-Empty` when the agent knows why — see *The endpoint* — and each surface says so on the first answer rather than after three:

- **Agent trouble: "Starting…"**, in the window, its title and the screensaver. Syd: "everything should say *Starting...* until the agent responds. Once the agent responds, it should display one of the messages", and "*Waiting for Photos* should be gone." A missing agent and a wedged one still read alike and differ in the log. **The About box keeps "Waiting for Photos"** — Syd: "keep the about box as it is." The wallpaper shows no words for it: it keeps its photograph, or the mark, until the agent answers — Syd's choice over a *Starting…* picture.
- **No sources: "Please add Photos"** — *"Please Add Photos" until 2026-09-27* — and the application opens its Settings window, once, when the state arrives. *It was "No Photos Selected", with "Add photos in Settings" underneath in the app only, for part of the same afternoon.*
- **Nothing to show and nothing coming: "No Photos Available"** — sources enabled, every one that is there scanned, and no photograph that could be shown, an offline source's cached ones included.
- **A cold start is still a bare `204`**, and still takes three empty answers to say *No Photos Available*. The *Loading photos* wording proposed above was dropped on 2026-09-19: nothing is said before it is known.
- **Every word capitalized, and nothing underneath any of them.** Syd dropped the 2026-09-21 sentence case ("Initial capitals, small everywhere else, except for 'Photos'"), and "No secondary lines of text" took *No Photos Available*'s line with it.
- **Either takes the picture down, at the next scheduled change.** Syd: "if there is truly nothing to display, the next time the picture is scheduled to change, you should display *No Photos Available*." `Shuffle` only asks when a dwell is up, so the answer arriving is that change. It is the one exception to *a picture already showing is never taken down*, and it is not a general retraction: a bare `204` still leaves the picture up. It also closes the TODO item *Removing every source leaves the window showing a photograph*, observed 2026-09-09.
- **The remembered picture goes with it** — the screensaver's `PictureMemory` and the wallpaper's `LastPicture` — so a start after a reboot does not put up a photograph that can no longer be served while a cold agent starts. Syd chose it for the screensaver, then: "wallpaper has same problem; same answer."

**Other surfaces need an answer too, and it is not the same one.** The wallpaper should leave whatever wallpaper is already there rather than replacing your desktop with a "No photos" image — an empty deck is not a reason to vandalize the desktop. A widget has no room to bounce anything and should show a static label with a tap target that opens the configuration screen. Both are defaults I would pick rather than requirements you stated; say so if either is wrong.

**The wallpaper's answer changed on 2026-09-26.** Syd: "for wallpaper and screensaver, can you generate an image and give it to them rather than direct drawing?" The wallpaper cannot draw — it hands the pane finished pictures — so when the agent says *no sources* or *no photos* it is handed a picture of the same words: white on black, at the desktop's size, still. A bare `204` or no agent still leaves the desktop alone. The screensaver keeps drawing its words, which move. See `Wallpaper Plan.md`, *An empty library, a missing agent, and the log*.

## Widgets on macOS, and where the store actually lives

**Wanted, 2026-09-15.** Syd: "I want to support image widgets on the Mac as well." Until then this section was analysis of what a Mac widget would cost rather than a commitment to build one. What follows still holds: the widget asks the agent over HTTP, so nothing about the storage design changes.

macOS has widgets — Notification Center and, since Sonoma, sitting on the desktop — and they use the same WidgetKit API as iOS. That makes a Mac widget nearly free in code terms, and it is another consumer with its own hand. But it has one consequence that reaches all the way back into the storage design.

**A widget extension is sandboxed even though the Mac agent is not.** App extensions on macOS require the sandbox; there is no opting out. So the unsandboxed agent writing to `~/Library/Application Support/Photo-Go-Round/` produces a store the widget cannot open, for exactly the same reason the screensaver cannot open it.

**Superseded by *The service is the interface*.** The widget will ask the agent over HTTP rather than open a store, so nothing needs to share a container, and the Mac's storage roots are not an App Group — see *Where the two directories go*. What follows is the reasoning it replaced, and the App Group spelling in it is still right for the day one is needed.

The fix is an App Group container, and it is worth adopting as *the* storage root on both platforms rather than as a Mac special case:

- `containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:)` resolves for sandboxed and unsandboxed processes alike, landing in `~/Library/Group Containers/<group>/` on macOS.
- Using it everywhere makes the Mac and iOS layouts symmetric, which is worth something given the kit has to run on both.
- On macOS, App Group identifiers for Developer ID applications must be prefixed with the team identifier — `TEAMID.com.sydpolk.photosgoround` rather than `group.com.sydpolk.photosgoround`. This differs from iOS convention and is a classic afternoon lost to a `nil` container URL. It also means the group identifier is not portable between the Mac and iOS builds, so it belongs in the `HostEnvironment` rather than in a shared constant.

This spike opens Phase 8 because it gates the Mac widget entirely, and because the combination — unsandboxed Developer ID host, sandboxed extension, shared group — is common enough to expect to work but specific enough to be worth ten minutes of proving rather than assuming.

**It does not help the screensaver.** A `.saver` bundle runs under `legacyScreenSaver`'s code signature and sandbox, not ours, so our App Group entitlement does not apply to it. The screensaver remains its own problem with its own spike in Phase 6.

**Everything else about Mac widgets follows the iOS design.** Same timeline provider, same refresh budget, same archived-image size ceiling, same "reserve a hand covering the entries about to be generated." The small widget-sized files that iOS writes for its widget's hand are needed on the Mac for the same jetsam reason, and live in `Caches` on both.

## What the Mac and iOS actually share

Building both hosts against one kit is only worth doing if the shared part is real. The backends are genuinely different, so it is worth being precise about where the seam falls.

**Identical on both platforms, and therefore in the kit:**

- The schema and its migrations. One set of tables, one migration sequence, byte-identical files.
- The deck algorithm. It is SQL over that schema — a window filter ordered by a random key, then one UPDATE to advance. Nothing about it is platform-specific.
- The source-provider protocol, the folder provider, and the Photos provider. PhotoKit is substantially the same API on macOS and iOS; the differences are permission flow and library availability, not asset fetching.
- Cache *policy*: which photos deserve to be resident, in what order to fetch them, what to evict when over the cap. Pure functions of deck state and a cache cap.

**Different, and therefore pushed onto the host:**

- **Execution model.** The Mac agent is a long-lived process that can fetch continuously for an hour. The iOS widget is invoked, gets a few hundred milliseconds to produce a `TimelineEntry`, and dies. There is no shared abstraction over those two things that is not a lie, so the kit exposes work as discrete callable units — `refresh(_:)`, `deal()`, `fetch(_:)`, `serve(to:)`, `evictIfNeeded()` — and never schedules anything itself. Concurrency is scheduling too: the kit deals and fetches one picture at a time and the host decides how many of those to run at once.
- **Storage roots.** An App Group container on both platforms — because macOS has widgets too, and a widget extension is sandboxed even when its host is not — plus possibly the `legacyScreenSaver` container for the Mac screensaver. The host supplies these through a `HostEnvironment` protocol; the kit never constructs a path from a hardcoded root. **On the Mac as built there is no App Group**: `HostEnvironment` names a container and a cache root; see *Where the two directories go*.
- **Caps and what gets stored.** One byte ceiling everywhere since 2026-09-06, 1 GB by default, originals decoded to size on demand — see *The iOS variant* — plus, on iOS, the one place a small file is written to disk — the widget's upcoming entries, because the rendered-entry memory ceiling makes handing a widget a full-resolution image an outright crash rather than a slowdown.
- **Change notification.** Darwin notifications on the Mac, `WidgetCenter.reloadTimelines` on iOS. Same protocol method, unrelated implementations.
- **Fetch aggressiveness.** The Mac can saturate the network at low QoS. iOS fetches opportunistically in the foreground plus a `BGProcessingTask` when charging, so its cache fills over days rather than minutes — a real behavioral difference the config UI should state plainly rather than hide.

The payoff for accepting this complexity up front is that the deck can never diverge between platforms, and that a bug in the shuffle is fixed once. The cost is that Phase 1 takes longer than a Mac-only kit would, because every kit API has to be designed to be callable from a process that is about to be killed — a cost paid up front even though iOS itself does not arrive until Phase 4.

## What a folder source means on iOS

On the Mac a folder source is a path, and an unsandboxed server reads it directly. iOS has no such thing, so the same source kind resolves differently — and it resolves into machinery that already exists.

**The locator is a security-scoped bookmark; the container copy is the cache.** `UIDocumentPickerViewController` or SwiftUI's `fileImporter` gets the user to their file in the Files app, and the resulting URL is preserved as bookmark data in `source.locator`. Reading it means resolving the bookmark inside `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()`. The app then copies the bytes into the App Group container — and that copy is a cache entry, not a separate category of thing.

This is the volume rule again rather than a new rule. On iOS nothing outside the container is guaranteed to stay put: a file provider can evict a local copy, iCloud Drive can dematerialize it, the provider app can be offline or uninstalled. Everything reachable through the picker is therefore in the "can go away" column, and everything in that column is materialized. macOS reference-in-place has no iOS analogue because iOS has no equivalent of the always-mounted internal volume.

Everything downstream then works unchanged. Cached copies count against the byte ceiling, are evicted like anything else, and are re-materialized by resolving the bookmark and reading again. If the bookmark goes stale — file deleted, provider gone, access revoked — the source goes unavailable and its cached photos decay exactly as an unplugged drive's do. No new eviction rule, no new failure path.

**One honest caveat, and it is a UI wording problem rather than a design one.** Because the container copy is a cache, a user who picks a file, then deletes the original in Files, will eventually lose that photo when the cache entry is evicted — where they may well have expected the app to have "imported" it permanently, the way Photos does. The contract is the same as everywhere else in this system, *gone from the source means gone from the deck*, and it is the right contract. But the interface should say **"added from Files"** rather than "imported," and should not use language implying a copy was kept. Retaining our own permanent copies instead would mean holding photos the user deliberately deleted, which is the same thing already rejected for `clonefile`.

Whole-folder sources work on iOS too, since the picker can return a directory URL. Enumerating one is subject to the same eviction caveats, so a directory source rescans in the foreground only, never from a widget timeline provider — which is a bad place to discover a file needs downloading from iCloud Drive.

## The iOS family

The widget is the execution model, as you correctly identified — it is the only thing that runs on a schedule without the user opening the app. But WidgetKit's model is narrower than you may be assuming: the widget extension does not run continuously and does not get to do meaningful background work. It gets woken to produce a `TimelineEntry`, with a budget of a few dozen refreshes a day, and it must return quickly.

So the deck advance on iOS happens *inside the timeline provider*: each entry generation deals the next photo, updates the row, and returns an entry pointing at a file in the App Group container. Bulk fetching from Photos happens in the app, when the app is foregrounded, plus a `BGProcessingTask` scheduled for when the device is charging. That is a real behavioral difference from the Mac — the iOS cache fills opportunistically rather than continuously — and the config UI should be honest about it.

No HTTP server. The widget extension shares an App Group container with the app; it can read image files and the SQLite database directly. A local HTTP server on iOS would be suspended along with the app the moment it backgrounds, so it would solve nothing while adding an entitlement and a security surface.

Note that widget images have a memory ceiling (roughly 30 MB for the rendered entry, and archived images well below that). This is the one consumer that cannot decode for itself, so the app writes small files sized to the widget family for the widget's outstanding hand — into `Caches`, regenerable, uncounted by the deck.

## Apple Watch, and why it breaks two of our rules

The Watch is the most constrained surface in the plan and the only one that violates decisions taken everywhere else. Both violations are forced, not chosen.

**It has no photo sources of its own.** watchOS has no Photos framework and no meaningful notion of user-visible folders, so there is nothing for a source provider to enumerate. The watch cannot build a library; it can only be handed one.

**It therefore cannot be an independent install.** The "no cross-device sync" decision holds because iCloud Photos already puts the same photos on every device — but it does not put them on the Watch. So the Watch is a genuine dependent of the paired iPhone, which becomes its feeder. This is the one place in the design where two devices have a relationship, and it is worth being explicit that it is a *feeding* relationship rather than a sync one: the phone decides, the watch displays. No deck lives on the watch, no shuffle happens there, and nothing on the watch is authoritative about anything.

So the Watch app is built as a companion and declares that dependency rather than degrading into it. watchOS permits independent apps that run without a paired phone; this one deliberately is not, because an unpaired watch would have an empty library and no way to fill it. Declaring the requirement means the failure is a clear "needs the iPhone app" at install time instead of a mysteriously blank widget later.

The mechanism is `WCSession.transferFile`, which queues transfers opportunistically and survives the app not running on either end — and since Phase 1.5 it is a *transport for the ordinary exchange* rather than a bespoke feeding arrangement. The watch asks at the size it is about to draw at, exactly like every other client, and the phone answers from its own in-process service; the phone no longer has to know watch pixel dimensions or rendering families. A small rolling set still lives on the watch — a handful, not a thousand — because a watch out of range of both the phone and the Mac cannot ask anyone anything, and it plays through what it has if a transfer is late.

**The watch talks to the phone and to nothing else.** It has no sources of its own, which is what the dependency was always about, and the phone runs a service already — so there is no case for the watch reaching the Mac directly, and none of the discovery or authorization that would have required.

**The rendering mode is the thing most likely to disappoint.** WidgetKit on watchOS renders through `widgetRenderingMode`, and on most watch faces complications render accented or vibrant rather than full color — which turns a photograph into a luminance mask. A photo complication on a watch face will not look like a photo. The Smart Stack is the surface where full color is actually available, so that is the realistic target, and `.accessoryRectangular` is the only family with enough room for an image to read as an image at all.

This is exactly the sort of thing worth ten minutes of proving before designing around, hence the spike: put a real photograph in each family on a real watch, look at it, and decide whether the watch face families are worth supporting at all or whether the Smart Stack is the whole feature.

**Everything else is smaller versions of known problems.** What the watch stores is tiny — watch-screen-sized, well under the widget memory ceiling — and it is the only copy there, not a derivative of a local original. Complication timeline reloads are budgeted more strictly than on iOS, so the watch advances its own display on the phone's schedule rather than trying to run a clock of its own. And storage on the watch is small enough that the rolling set is measured in single-digit megabytes.

*Caveat, as elsewhere in this plan: the rendering-mode behavior described here is what held through the watchOS versions I know. Verify against the installed SDK before designing Phase 9 in detail.*

## tvOS storage

tvOS is the awkward one. Apps get a small persistent container and everything else lives in `Caches`, which the system purges under pressure without asking. A 1000-photo cache of full-resolution originals is not something tvOS will let you keep. The realistic tvOS design is a much smaller rolling cache (a few hundred megabytes), refilled from either iCloud Photos directly or from a Mac on the same network, plus a Top Shelf extension for the pretty part. Worth confirming this is acceptable before Phase 10 rather than discovering it during.

## Why nothing syncs between devices

Each install is its own world: its own database, its own cache, its own shuffle. This is a decision, not an omission, and it is worth recording why it is the right one.

`PHAsset.localIdentifier` is not stable across devices — the same iCloud photo has a different local identifier on your Mac and your iPhone. Any shared deck would therefore need `PHCloudIdentifier` and `PHPhotoLibrary.cloudIdentifierMappings(forLocalIdentifiers:)` to establish that two rows are the same photo. That call is slow enough to need batching and caching, and it simply fails for assets that have not finished uploading. Every row in the schema would have to carry a second identity that is sometimes absent, and every join would have to tolerate that.

Against that cost, the benefit is nearly zero. iCloud Photos already guarantees both devices see the same photos, so both are shuffling the same pool. Two independent shuffles of the same pool are indistinguishable from one shared shuffle unless you are staring at a Mac and an iPad side by side and comparing. The only case where independence is visibly worse is that you re-pick your albums on each device — a one-time cost of about a minute.

There is a second, quieter benefit: no sync means no CloudKit account state to handle, no "sync is paused because you are out of storage," no merge conflicts when two devices deal simultaneously, and no schema versioning contract between an old iPhone build and a new Mac build. The database on each device answers only to the code on that device.

The folder sources make this cleaner still. Folder sources are inherently local — a path on your Mac has no meaning on an iPad — so even a configuration-only sync would have been partial, syncing album picks but not folder picks. Independence makes that asymmetry disappear rather than requiring an explanation in the UI.

If this ever changes, the migration is additive: a nullable cloud-identity column and a sync table. It is not a schema the current design forecloses, just one it declines to pay for now.

## Configuration, and noticing external `defaults write`

Preferences live in the `com.sydpolk.photogoround` domain — `.dev` in development, or whatever `PGR_PREFS_SUITE` names *(since 2026-09-24, the build's one domain: `com.sydpolk.photosgoround[.debug|.claude]`)*; the database holds state. `pgr_ctl set` is the blessed way to change a preference because it knows the right domain and posts the change notification afterwards. But raw `defaults write` must work too, from any terminal, with no cooperation — that was an original requirement and it is the harder half.

**The mechanism, because "observe `UserDefaults`" is not one.** `UserDefaults.didChangeNotification` and KVO on a defaults key are documented for in-process changes. Cross-process they are unreliable — sometimes they fire, sometimes late, sometimes not at all — so nothing may depend on them. What actually works is watching the backing store and re-reading:

- **Poll, and do not watch.** A re-read every thirty seconds is the mechanism, not the backstop. This follows the same conclusion as folder scanning, for the same reason: the cost is nil and the only thing bought by watching is latency nobody can perceive on a setting like a dwell time or a cache cap.

  The watcher this replaces was not cheap to get right, which is most of the argument. `defaults` writes through `cfprefsd`, which replaces the plist atomically via rename — so a `DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource` on a file descriptor is invalidated by the very event we care about, its descriptor now pointing at an unlinked inode. Getting it right meant watching the *containing directory* with an FSEvents stream, or re-arming the vnode source on every `.rename` and `.delete`. That is the single most common way to implement this wrong and have it work in testing, then silently stop after the first write. Deleting it removes a whole class of bug we would only have discovered weeks later.
- **Force a re-read before reading.** `cfprefsd` caches aggressively, and a stale value in our process is the default outcome. Call `CFPreferencesAppSynchronize` for the domain — or `UserDefaults.synchronize()`, deprecated but still the mechanism — before pulling values, or we will faithfully notice a change and then read the old number. This matters *more* without a watcher, not less: the poll is only as good as the read it performs.
- **`pgr_ctl set` rings the doorbell, so the blessed path stays instant.** Polling is the floor, not the ceiling. A write through `pgr_ctl` posts the Darwin notification immediately and the change lands at once; only a raw `defaults write` from a terminal waits for the next poll, and that is the path nobody uses when they are in a hurry.
- ~~**Then broadcast.** Having noticed, the server posts the Darwin notification so the app, the widget, and the saver re-read too.~~ **Corrected 2026-09-12: it does not.** Notifications flow from the outside world to the service and never back — an agent ringing its own doorbell drove a refresh loop — so the app, the saver, and the wallpaper ask over HTTP or read their own settings instead. See *The doorbell rings back at you*.

**No preference ever requires restarting the agent.** This is a hard requirement, and it does not follow automatically from noticing the change — noticing is only half. Every preference needs a defined *apply* action, and "it will pick that up next time it starts" is never one of them.

The trap is timers. The obvious implementation reads the interval once at launch and schedules a `DispatchSourceTimer`; changing the interval from thirty minutes to five then does nothing until the next launch, or at best takes effect in thirty minutes. Correct behavior is to cancel and reschedule on change, computing the next fire from the *last deal* rather than from now — so shortening an interval that has already elapsed deals immediately, and lengthening one does not fire twice.

The rest of the apply table:

| Preference | Applied by |
| --- | --- |
| Rotation interval / dwell | Cancel and reschedule the timer against the last deal time. **As built**: the window's and the saver's dwell is a constant, not a preference; the wallpaper re-reads `intervalSeconds` every round and checks back within thirty seconds |
| Cache byte ceiling | The eviction after the agent's next write to the cache evicts to it (*the next maintenance pass, until 2026-09-16*); raising it simply lets the cache hold more |
| Download concurrency | Next top-up. Fetches already in flight finish on the old setting |
| Repeat window fraction | Next deal; recomputed from the current pool size, no state to rebuild |
| Queue size | Next top-up. Raising it lets the queue grow; lowering it stops producers being asked until serving brings it under |
| Fit, transition, pan speed | The consumer re-renders the *current* photo immediately, so the effect is visible while you are still looking at it. None of these is a preference yet |
| Source enabled / disabled | Deck query changes on the next deal; a rescan is queued if the source was newly enabled |

A corollary for the code: nothing reads a preference into a stored property at initialization. Values are read through accessors that reflect current state, so there is no cached copy to go stale and no init-order dependency to reason about. **One exception as built**: the wallpaper reads its *enabled* setting once, at construction, so a `defaults write` to it takes effect at the app's next launch; the checkbox changes it directly.

**Validate everything read from a preference.** `defaults write` accepts anything — a string where a number belongs, a negative cache cap, a dwell time of zero, a transition name that does not exist. Every preference read is therefore a parse with a default and a clamp, and an invalid value is logged and ignored rather than accepted. This is not defensive programming for its own sake; it is the direct consequence of exposing a typed configuration surface to an untyped command.

**Which domain, which is the part that will waste an afternoon if not written down — corrected 2026-09-12, because as built it is simpler than this section planned.** It planned three: an App Group suite, the screensaver's own `ScreenSaverDefaults` domain, and a stray `com.sydpolk.photogoround` nothing read. As built, the agent's settings and the source list live in `com.sydpolk.photogoround` itself — `com.sydpolk.photogoround.dev` in development — in `~/Library/Preferences/`, which is exactly what a person types *(since 2026-09-24, the build's one domain, `com.sydpolk.photosgoround[.debug|.claude]`)*; there is no App Group suite and nothing watches a second domain. The screensaver has no settings of its own *(it has a domain since, `….screensaver` beside the build's; `ScreensaverPreferences`)*, and reads the agent's plist file directly for the port, because its sandbox hands it an empty suite — see `Screensaver Plan.md`. **2026-09-10:** the wallpaper adds domains of its own, `com.sydpolk.photogoround.wallpaper.{dev|prod}` *(`com.sydpolk.photosgoround[.debug|.claude].wallpaper` since 2026-09-24)*, holding its interval (`intervalSeconds`), each display's change time and file, and its *Also set wallpapers* setting — nothing the server reads. *2026-09-16: those domains hold one key, `interval`, a *Shuffle All* tag; the rest went with the app's loop.*

On iOS an App Group suite would carry app-to-widget settings — the Mac has none — with `WidgetCenter.shared.reloadTimelines` as the wake mechanism. There is no external `defaults write` to worry about there.

## Sandboxing and entitlements ledger

| Target | Sandbox | Notable entitlements / permissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mac agent | No | `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`. **As built, 2026-09-12**: no entitlements file, no App Group, and no hardened runtime yet; Developer ID and notarization are the 1.0 target. **Signed with Developer ID and notarized since 2026-09-23.** **Since 2026-09-23**: hardened runtime in all three configurations, and `Photos-Go-Round Server.entitlements` carrying `com.apple.security.personal-information.photos-library` — without it a hardened agent is refused PhotoKit |
| Mac config app | No | Same; ~~registers the agent via `SMAppService`~~ installs a per-user LaunchAgent plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` (2026-09-10; decided, not built). Probably ships as a menu-bar app rather than the full window — TODO.md, *A menu-bar app for shipping*. **Since 2026-09-23**: hardened, with `Photos-Go-Round.entitlements` carrying the same Photos entitlement, since `SourceService` calls PhotoKit too |
| Mac widget | Yes — extensions must be | App Group; sandboxed despite its host not being |
| `.saver` bundle | Inherited from host | The host's, as the 2026-09-07 spike read them: network client granted, read-only `/`, no XPC; our entitlements do not apply |
| iOS/iPadOS app | Yes | Photos read, App Group, background processing |
| iOS widget | Yes | App Group |
| tvOS | Yes | App Group; no meaningful persistent storage |
| visionOS | Yes | Photos read, App Group |

The Mac side being unsandboxed is what makes arbitrary folder access, wallpaper setting, and cross-container cache writes possible without security-scoped bookmark ceremony. The iOS side is sandboxed regardless, but there the container model is a natural fit anyway.

## Two Mac products, sandboxed and Pro

Syd, 2026-09-15: "my long-term vision has clarified. I will submit an app store version that is sandboxed, and the app will do what it can (set wallpaper while app is running, enable widgets, maybe setup screensaver), and it might have to have the agent internal to the app and only be able to do anything while it is running. I will have a separate pro version for sale on my own site which will have the full integration."

**Refined 2026-09-22 by `Product Strategy.md`.** **Recorded, not planned.** Syd the same day: "don't worry about that long-term strategy yet; just put it in PLAN.md", and "for now, we have full reign over the mac to do whatever we like." So nothing below constrains what is built now, and no phase, decision or code changes for it yet.

- **The App Store version is sandboxed and does what it can while it is open:** the wallpaper set from the running app, widgets, and perhaps some screensaver setup. The agent may have to live inside the app, which would mean nothing happens while the app is closed.
- **The Pro version is sold from Syd's own site and carries the full integration:** the separate agent, the screensaver, and the wallpaper extension in System Settings › Wallpaper, which uses private frameworks and temporary exceptions and can never pass review. See `Wallpaper Plan.md`, *The real extension, inside the app*.
- **What this settles in advance:** the question *whether* to sandbox stops being one decision for one product. *The sandbox contingency* below reads as the App Store version's cost sheet, and this document's unsandboxed Mac is the Pro version.
- **What it leaves open:** everything. Which surfaces the store version keeps, whether an in-app agent is acceptable, how one codebase builds both, pricing, and when either ships.

## The sandbox contingency

The plan runs the Mac app and agent unsandboxed, which is what Developer ID distribution allows and what makes arbitrary folder access, wallpaper setting, and cross-container cache writes straightforward. But sandboxing may turn out to be forced rather than chosen, and it is worth being clear about what would force it and what it would cost.

**What might force it.** Sandboxing gives the app a container, and containers are what App Groups and extension sharing are designed around. If the Phase 8 spike shows that an unsandboxed host cannot share a group container with its sandboxed widget extension, the cheapest fix is to sandbox the host rather than to abandon the widget. Any future decision to put the Mac app in the App Store would force it outright.

**What it costs.** Four things, in descending order of pain:

- **The screensaver becomes undeliverable from the app.** A sandboxed app cannot write to `~/Library/Screen Savers`. The saver would have to be distributed and installed separately, which means a second signing pipeline and a manual install step.
- **Every folder needs a security-scoped bookmark.** Folder sources stop being paths and become bookmarks that must be resolved inside `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` and released after, with a stale-bookmark path to handle. This is the change that reaches furthest into Phase 1 code.
- **Wallpaper setting gets constrained.** `NSWorkspace.setDesktopImageURL` from a sandboxed process needs the image inside the container or reachable via a bookmark, which pushes toward materializing even referenced folder photos. **2026-09-10:** the wallpaper writes its own copy of every picture it shows, so it never points the desktop at an original and this cost is already paid. What would move is where those copies live — `Application Support` for now, and Syd: "we will probably have to move it if we want to sandbox." *Moot since 2026-09-16: the app's `NSWorkspace` loop was removed, and the wallpaper is the extension, which runs sandboxed already and keeps its last picture in its own container.*
- **The `legacyScreenSaver` container trick becomes impossible.** Writing into another app's container is exactly what the sandbox exists to prevent, so the screensaver would fall to the HTTP or journal rungs of the ladder — which costs nothing now, since it already uses HTTP.

**The insurance, which is cheap and belongs in Phase 1.** Never construct a `URL` from a stored path at a call site. Every file access goes through a small `FileAccess` abstraction in the kit that takes a source's locator and vends a URL for the duration of a closure. Unsandboxed, it resolves a path and does nothing else. Sandboxed, it resolves a bookmark, starts access, runs the closure, and stops access. The provider code is identical either way, and the decision to sandbox becomes one implementation swap rather than an archaeology expedition through every `URL(fileURLWithPath:)` in the project.

Storing bookmark data alongside the path from the very first commit — even while running unsandboxed and ignoring it — costs one nullable column and removes the need for a migration later. It also happens to be the same column the rename-and-move tracking wants.

### Whether the App Store is reachable

Moved here from `TODO.md`, where it asked whether *Platform and distribution*'s "a sandboxed app cannot install a `.saver` bundle" was the answer or only the decision to re-examine.

- **Answered 2026-09-25: no.** The mechanism exists and review policy forbids it. A store app could hand its bundled `.saver` to System Settings, which is what Launch Services binds `.saver` files to, but App Store Review Guideline 2.4.5(ii) says Mac App Store apps "must also be self-contained, single app installation bundles and cannot install code or resources in shared locations", and `~/Library/Screen Savers` is one; a developer who tried reported a rejection. 2.4.5(iii), no code running at login without consent, is a second wall for the agent. The store's own "screensaver" apps confirm it: Apple's search API lists about a dozen, and every one is either a full-screen window on the app's own idle timer (Aquarium Live HD: "replaces the system screensaver by default, or in-app screensaver timer can be set"), a hotkey for the saver already selected (Screensaver Now), or a slideshow whose real screensaver is a separate download from the developer's site (ArtSaverApp: a "companion screensaver (going into System Settings)", not in the store app). Painted Rooms says outright that third-party apps cannot replace the system screensaver. *The screensaver's tile in System Settings, done 2026-09-24, changes nothing here: two PNG files in the bundle, no private API — `Screensaver Plan.md`, The tile in the Screen Saver pane.*
- **The agent is the harder half, not the saver.** It is unsandboxed by design: it opens SQLite and the cache directly, binds a localhost listener, holds the Photos TCC grant, and registers as a per-user LaunchAgent. Sandboxing it means an App Group container for the database and cache, `com.apple.security.network.server` for the listener, `network.client` for everything that asks, and re-testing every path that touches a file.
- **`pgr_ctl` is not a constraint here.** It is a debugging tool and need not ship at all, so a sandboxed build simply leaves it out and it keeps the direct database access that is the rig's whole premise. The consequence worth knowing is that the shipped configuration would then be one nothing exercises from a terminal — a fact to hold, not a problem to solve.
- **The widget already forces part of this**: an app extension is sandboxed on macOS whether we like it or not, which is why the agent serves over HTTP rather than sharing a store.
- **The wallpaper extension costs the App Store, not the sandbox.** Syd, 2026-09-14: "reverse-engineering the wallpaper extension API will mean we can't sandbox this." The one Apple extension on that point whose entitlements were read is itself signed with `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`, so the extension runs sandboxed rather than preventing it; what its private entitlement and private frameworks rule out is App Store review. Syd: "you are right about the App Store; that is what I meant." Both wallpapers were to stay — "We will continue to support both until I decide on trying to sandbox or not" — and two days later the app's own `NSWorkspace` loop was removed, 2026-09-16, to come back from git if a sandboxed version needs it; the wallpaper is the extension. `Wallpaper Plan.md`, *Getting into System Settings › Wallpaper* and *The app's loop, removed*.
- **Private API is not disqualifying for the Developer ID build.** Shipping direct means no review, so it is on the table if some need for it appears. The need once named — an animated preview in the Screen Saver pane — turned out not to exist, 2026-09-09: the pane runs an ordinary live instance of our saver, and it animates and cycles photographs.

## Known shortcomings and leftovers

Recorded rather than remembered. Everything here is a real gap in what is built, found either by running the thing or by auditing after a refactor. Ordered roughly by how much they would cost to leave.

**Wrong behaviour, worth fixing now**

1. **A file edited in place is never noticed.** A refresh compares storage and byte size, so an edit that preserves the byte count — a crop re-encoded to the same length, a metadata rewrite — leaves the stale copy cached for ever. Wants a `modified_at` column compared on refresh, treated as re-fetch rather than as a new entry so it keeps its place in the rotation. ~~**It now leaves stale *renderings* too**, which nothing invalidates.~~ Renderings went on 2026-09-06, so a stale original is the whole of this again.

**Dead weight left by refactoring**

2. **`ScanChange` and `ScanResult` are named for a method called `refresh`.** Small, but the vocabulary should be one word.

**Declared but not wired up**


**Cosmetic**

3. **A folder that never existed is reported as "no longer at this path."** The check cannot tell "moved" from "never there", and says the more alarming of the two.

**Done since this list was written**

- **The cache was a lottery, and a night of running proved it.** Photographs were fetched and then not shown, because a fetched card left the queue and had to be dealt again — a uniform draw from fourteen thousand. Two network sources went from 123 pictures an hour to zero for five hours. Reversed under *Why a fetched picture rejoins the queue after all*, together with pacing the deal to pictures served and placing every card at a random position.
- **`times_shown` was never the number it sounded like.** It counts a photograph being chosen, not shown: a render failure raises it and displays nothing. `times_delivered` is the honest one, and the gap between them is the only report of photographs the deck thinks you have seen and you have not.
- **A refresh blocked the agent for eighty-five minutes**, and nothing said so. It asked the provider about every photograph it already held, one round trip each; on a network volume that is most of a second apiece. Because the main loop awaits the refresh, everything else stopped with it — preferences unread, doorbells unanswered, a source added at 00:13 still unscanned at 00:20. The symptom was "the agent is not doing anything", diagnosed by ringing the preferences doorbell and getting no answer at all. Departures now fall out of the walk that just ran, via a `walk_seen` temp table. Same source, 1.1 seconds.
- **The launch purge deleted exactly the cards that would warm the cache.** Two network sources of 5,899 photographs had never once been shown. Written up under *What running it found*, along with the ordering fix, the walk budget, look-ahead, and `QueueFiller`'s reduction from 150 lines to 94 — 125 lines as of 2026-09-12. Look-ahead has since gone; see the next bullet.
- **The look-ahead backlog was unbounded**, so a night of serving would have queued a fetch for every photograph in the library. Capped at fifty waiting; a refused request is not blacklisted. **Look-ahead and its backlog went on 2026-09-05**, replaced by the queue's fetcher, whose only bound is the queue itself.
- **A cold start dealt a full queue it could not serve.** With the database deleted and the cache empty, the queue filled with twenty perfectly good cards and the walk answered `204` on every one — `out of cards, walked 20` — because each card's bytes were still coming over the wire. Two things fix it, and the first alone does nothing. **A bridge of three immediately-servable cards** at launch: `referenced` files are read in place and need no fetch, and a warm restart still holds whatever was cached. **And the first pass walks local sources first**, because in the order sources were added the one local folder — 8,287 photographs, all readable instantly — sat last behind ten network folders and minutes of traffic. Only the first pass: after it the queue is full and there is nothing to be first for. iCloud folders count as remote, since `~/Library/Mobile Documents` looks local and may be evicted placeholders.

  **Three cards rather than a queueful, and the number is the whole point.** Filling twenty from the one local folder would put twenty consecutive pictures from a single source on the screen. Three is enough that a request right now succeeds and the next couple do too, which is all the time the ordinary shuffled cards need for their fetches to land. The bridge shuts off the moment the queue is full and says so. **The bridge went with the servable-only pool**; the local-first first pass stays. See *Cold start*.

  **It changes latency and nothing else.** The deck's proportions are untouched — the bridge decides which three cards are in the queue at second one, not how anything is chosen: not the shuffle keys, not eligibility, not the repeat window, not the selection rule. There is exactly one transient at startup and it is *pool completeness*, not distribution: cards dealt while a source is still being catalogued were drawn from a pool that did not yet contain it. That resolves as the queue turns over — twenty pictures, four minutes at the usual dwell — and it resolves completely, because a newly catalogued photograph arrives with a fresh shuffle key and a null `last_dealt_seq` and so competes on equal terms from its first moment. What does *not* change afterwards is the share each source has: on this library the local folder is 43% of 19,487 photographs, so nearly one picture in two being a desktop picture is the shuffle working rather than the bridge still in force.
- **Two live-agent hazards, both found by tripping over them.** A second agent started with `--container` and `--cache-root` is *not* isolated: the port lives in preferences, so it publishes over the running agent's and the app silently follows it to the wrong library. And `--add-folder` on such a run writes into the real source list. Standing up a scratch agent needs an isolated preference suite as well as isolated storage — `PGR_PREFS_SUITE` is the environment form, and there is still no flag — and notification topics are global regardless, so even an isolated scratch agent's rings reach the real one. Since 2026-08-24 a `--once` run is safe on its own: it never starts the listener, so the published port is left exactly as it was found. **Both hazards are guarded now**: `--no-publish` stops a scratch agent publishing its port, and `--add-folder` on relocated storage without `PGR_PREFS_SUITE` is refused.
- **The endpoint had no test that served a picture.** `PictureEndpoint` was
  covered by one file, and every test in it ran against an empty library — so
  nothing exercised rendering, the cache, or the headers, and the
  fresh-index-per-request bug above would have stayed green for ever. It now has
  a suite that drives `route` directly, over a **single-photograph library**:
  serving pops the queue, so with one photograph every request is the same card,
  which is what makes a hit observable at all. It caught a bug on its first run —
  a cache *hit* reported `X-PGR-Pixels` as the box that was asked for rather than
  the pixels actually sent, so one header meant two things depending on cache
  state. Failing test, then fix, then passing test.
- **Phase 1.5 is complete: the renderer and the rendering cache.** `w` and `h`
  name a box, the service fits the photograph inside it and encodes to whatever
  `Accept` allows, and the result is kept so the same photograph at the same size
  decodes once. **The keeping was removed on 2026-09-06** — see *The resize cache
  is removed*; the renderer, the box, and the `Accept` negotiation all stand, and
  so do both bugs below. Two bugs surfaced by running it that the suite did not catch, and
  both are worth keeping. **New rows were getting no UUID at all** — migration 4
  backfilled the existing ones and nothing generated them on insert, so every
  scan after it failed on a NOT NULL index. And **the endpoint built a fresh
  `PhotoCache` per request, each with its own empty index**, so it wrote
  renderings and never saw them again: a hundred per cent misses against a cache
  that was full on disk. The index is now one per process, shared by the
  endpoint, the producer, and maintenance. Neither was reachable from a unit
  test; both took twenty seconds against a live agent.

- **`MacHostEnvironment.appGroupIdentifier` is deleted.** It was kept for Phase 5's and Phase 8's widgets, whose App Group container Phase 1.5 removes the need for — a widget asks the service instead. What it was really preserving was a spelling, which belongs here rather than in an uncalled constant: **on macOS the App Group must be team-ID prefixed — `R5PQPZARC5.com.sydpolk.photosgoround`, not `group.com.sydpolk.photosgoround`.** Getting it wrong yields a nil container URL rather than an error, which is a classic afternoon lost, and the prefix differs between the Mac and iOS builds so it was never a shared constant either. `directoryName` still has a job and stays.
- **Filling moved out of the agent and into the kit, and `SourceWorker` and `SourceWorkers` went with it.** Deciding *keep asking while the queue is short and this source still has something* is policy about the queue; which thread runs it and when the heartbeat fires is scheduling. Welded together in the host they were unreachable by the test suite, which is why a regression that cut a small library to one picture every five seconds survived. `QueueFiller` now holds the policy, takes *is it short* and *produce one* as injected closures, holds no database connection of its own, and has seven tests as of 2026-09-12, with no clock in any of them. The in-flight counting that let a source ignore a request while busy is done by the lane model and a per-round guard instead, so both worker types are gone along with their tests.
- **Selection and claim were not atomic.** Picking a candidate and queuing it were separated by a fetch, so two producers asking one source could pick the same picture and both download it — reachable rather than theoretical, since a source runs four fetches at once. Selection now claims the photo in the same `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, the claim is released when the picture reaches the queue or the attempt fails, and it expires so a producer that dies mid-fetch sidelines nothing. No reaper. **Reversed since**: choosing a candidate is read-only and takes no claim, the queue refuses a photograph it already holds, and the claim belongs to the queue's fetcher. See *Consequences of one shared queue*.
- **The seven inspect verbs left `photogoroundd`.** `serve`, `status`, `source`, `queue`, `get`/`set` and the service verbs now live in `pgr_ctl`, so "the service does one thing" is true of the binary and not merely of its default. The agent has two cases left, and one of them prints usage. `serve` has since been retired in favour of `curl`, and `source` became `sources`.
- **The status line lied about the cache cap twice over.** It reported `0/1000 cached` for a boot-volume library that is referenced in place and can never cache anything, which reads as a stalled fetch; and it froze the cap it was born with, so raising `cachePhotoCap` from a terminal left it reporting the old number for ever. Both fixed. `cachePhotoCap` itself has since gone; the cache is bounded by `cacheByteCeiling`, in bytes.
- `.sourcesChanged` was announced and nobody listened, so a source added from a terminal sat idle until the next scheduled refresh. The agent now observes it and refreshes within a tick — verified against a live agent with the scan interval set to an hour.
- `CacheSettings.chunkSize` and `burstSize` were vestigial after chunked ingestion went, along with their preferences. Removed.
- `DarwinNotification.deckAdvanced` was a topic nobody rang; serving now posts it.
- `consumerIdleTimeoutSeconds` was parsed and clamped and never consulted — nothing asked which consumers had gone quiet. Removed; `consumer.seen_at` stays as the heartbeat, which `touch` does write, and the timeout can come back when something actually reports idleness.
- Dead API removed after an audit: `PhotoQueue.depthBySource`, `Source.contributesToDeck` (a second name for `enabled`), `PhotoExistence.isAbsent`, `Statement.optionalDouble`, and `Preferences.bundleDomain` (a second spelling of `Deployment.identifier`). All had zero call sites. `Preferences.removeSource(locator:)` was on this list and came back: it is how removing a source reaches the durable list.
- Sources can be named at launch with `PGR_FOLDERS`, so Phase 1 needs no CLI.
- The queue filled at one round of requests per tick rather than re-asking on each answer — four pictures every five seconds against a folder that fills a thousand-entry queue in three. Fixed, and written up under *Filling*.
- A pool smaller than the queue's target had no stopping condition, so a small library meant a producer spinning against a queue that already held everything. The stopping condition is the source that answers *nothing*, remembered for the round. **An earlier fix paced this on the maintenance tick instead, and that was a regression**: it reintroduced the one-round-per-tick filling that had just been removed, but only when the pool was smaller than the queue — so the 7,955-photo staging run never took the branch and a fifty-photo library took it every time, yielding one picture every five seconds however fast the queue drained. Measured at 6 pictures out of 40 requests before, 40 out of 40 after.
- **Serving did not ask for more.** `PhotoQueue`'s own documentation says serving is the only thing that shortens the queue and therefore the only thing that can notice it has run low — and nothing in the agent ever acted on it; only the maintenance tick asked. `pgr_ctl serve` topped up inline, which is why this survived the Phase 2 gate, but no HTTP client could. The endpoint now asks after every picture it hands over, including when it hands over nothing.
- The agent printed a count of sources and nothing about them. It now names each one at startup with its photo count and whether it is recursive, disabled, unavailable, or not yet scanned — the whole class of "it is running but showing nothing" is visible in the first second rather than after a session of reading the log.
- The `run` verb is gone; a bare invocation runs the agent.
- A refresh held the whole library in memory three times over — the provider's full enumeration, a dictionary of every existing row, and a `Set` of every external identifier. All three are gone, and with them the two per-file costs underneath. Written up under *Scanning is constant-memory, and what it took*.
- The folder walk reconstructed each photo's relative identifier by stripping a prefix off its absolute path, which needed three candidate prefixes to cope with `/var` versus `/private/var`. `.producesRelativePathURLs` replaces all of it, and removed the walk's `autoreleasepool` as a side effect by not making the allocation it was draining.
- An unavailable source printed its alert at every refresh and, worse, announced itself each time — and the agent observes its own announcements, so a missing folder drove a refresh loop. Both fixed; see *The doorbell rings back at you*.
- Recursion applied to a whole run rather than to each folder, so a flat directory and a nested tree could not be added in one command. Each source now carries its own, defaulting off.
- The tests leaked a preferences plist per run, five hundred of them. Bounded now, and the reason the obvious fix fails is written up under *Testing strategy*.
- `sources changed; refreshing now` was narrating routine work on every doorbell. Removed; what a refresh *finds* is still printed.
- The staging run had been minutes rather than a day. It has now run 10h08m unattended, which closes the Phase 1 gate; the numbers are under *Phase 1*. What it did **not** exercise is serving — nothing drew a picture for ten hours, so the deal path, eviction, and the repeat window went untouched. That is Phase 2's gate, not a gap in this one.

**Known and deliberately deferred**

4. ~~**No Xcode project until Phase 3.**~~ **Done: every product is a target in `Photos-Go-Round.xcodeproj` since 2026-09-08 (`Photo-Go-Round.xcodeproj` until 2026-09-22)**, and the App Group container question it was waiting on went away instead of being settled. See *The agent: registration and permissions*.
5. **The agent bundle and `SMAppService` are no longer ahead of schedule.** Phase 1.5 puts the service on the critical path for every surface, so a login item is needed from Phase 3 rather than from Phase 6, and this finding moves from recorded-and-deferred to blocking. `Scripts/make-agent-bundle.sh` assembles an `LSUIElement` app, and `pgr_ctl` has `register` / `unregister` / `service-status` verbs, which still take the `SMAppService` route. None of it is needed until there is a surface that wakes up on its own and expects the library to be there — the screensaver, the wallpaper, the widgets, and probably the Mac app that registers it on their behalf. Recorded because it exists and because the finding is worth keeping: `SMAppService.agent(plistName:)` reports `.notFound` from that bundle, having ruled out a missing plist, five plist shapes, ad-hoc versus Developer ID signing, and `Bundle.main` resolution. What is left is that the process probably has to be launched by LaunchServices as an app, which is how it will actually be used. **Superseded 2026-09-10:** the agent installs as a per-user plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, with the binary left in the app bundle, so `SMAppService.agent`'s `.notFound` no longer blocks anything. Decided, not built. See *The agent: registration and permissions*.
6. **Watching the filesystem is Phase 3 work; revoking a photo already on screen is post-0.1.** See *Revoking a photo that is already on screen*. The serve-time check covers hand-off and nothing else, so every surface that displays a photo for longer than an instant can show one that has since been deleted — the wallpaper worst of all. **0.1 ships with that.** The watcher (`FSEventStream`, `PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver`) was to arrive with the app, which exists, and it has not; the `.photoRevoked` topic and `GET /v1/revocations?since=` wait until there are surfaces to judge them against.
7. **tvOS and visionOS have no answer for where their service runs.** Every other platform serves itself — the Mac from its agent, iOS in-process, the Watch fed by its phone — and these two are simply unexamined. The questions are whether an app on either can run something that survives long enough to keep a queue full, what a tvOS app may keep in a container that is not purged under pressure (see *tvOS storage*), and whether visionOS is close enough to iOS that the in-process shape carries straight over. **Investigate before designing**: the answer decides whether they are ordinary hosts of the kit or whether they need feeding by something else, the way the Watch does.
8. **The response names the picture — done 2026-09-12.** A client was handed bytes, a card id and a deal ordinal, and nothing it could show a person or use as a filename — which is what made saving one from `curl` awkward enough to notice. `X-PGR-Name` now carries a Photos photograph's recorded original filename, or otherwise its identifier, **stripped of its extension**, because from step 2 onward the format returned is the one the client asked for through `Accept` rather than the one the original had, so the original extension would be a lie. `X-PGR-Source-Name` names the source beside it, and both are percent-encoded.

    **Revised 2026-09-12 to what was built.** This item asked for the last path component alone; the header carries a folder photograph's whole path inside its folder, so a recursive folder yields `2019/summer/sunset-05`. It was built that way first — for the dashboard and the logs, from a request that did not mention this item, which was not checked beforehand — and Syd kept the path and had the extension stripped. **Only the header strips it**: the log lines and the dashboard name the original file, where its extension is true.
9. **The logger is not abstracted, so nothing that logs can be tested.** `Log` interpolates straight into `Logger`, and those records go to the system's log store — read back with `log show`, long after anything could assert on them. That is the same problem as a data lake: the logs exist and are not queryable by a test. What it wants is a logger behind a seam, defaulting to `os_log`, that a test can replace with a collector and then read — asserting the contents, or just the count. `PictureEndpoint.Served` is the shape that works, and is currently the only place with it: a value describing what happened, and an injected sink that formats and reports. **`os_log` must stay the default** rather than a file, because it is the only mechanism that works from inside the screensaver's and the widget's sandboxes, where a hand-rolled file logger could not write at all.

    **Partly, for errors only, 2026-09-12.** `Logger.error(kind:_:into:)` records into an `AgentErrors` a test can hand in and read, and `Console.recordAlerts` does the same for red lines. Every other level still goes straight to `os_log`.
10. **Hand-rolled parsing lets the help text drift from the parser.** Both binaries build their usage as a string literal, so nothing connects a flag to its documentation and nothing fails when they disagree. It has already bitten: changing `--recursive` into a modifier on the folder it precedes left both `EXAMPLES` sections showing `--add-folder <path> -r`, which the new parser *rejects* — usage text that would not run. **`swift-argument-parser` generates the option list from the declarations**, so a flag cannot exist undocumented and a rename cannot leave the help behind. **The examples are tested now**: both binaries have a test that runs every `EXAMPLES` line through its parser, so what is left is the option list drifting from the parser.

    Three things to weigh before adopting it, because this is not a free win. It is an SPM dependency, and *No argument-parsing package* rules one out on the grounds that the no-dependencies rule has no Apple exception — so taking it is a reversal of a stated decision rather than an omission being corrected. It would not have caught the failure above either: `EXAMPLES` is prose in a `discussion` block and drifts exactly as it does now, so the examples still want a test that runs them. And the grammar may not survive the move: `--add-folder [--recursive] <path>`, where a flag modifies the value of the option it precedes, is not something a declarative parser expresses, so adopting it could mean changing the command line rather than merely how it is parsed.
11. **The migrator refuses a database from a newer build.** Given the database is disposable, deleting and rebuilding would be a friendlier answer than an error — at the cost of one rescan. Worth revisiting when there is a second build to be older than.

## Expect the plan to change, and where it can absorb it

Every phase after the third adds a surface that lives under rules we do not control, and each one is the first genuine test of assumptions made before it. The widget may force sandboxing. The screensaver may force a journal instead of direct database access. tvOS may force a different cache policy entirely. This is not a risk to be eliminated by planning harder — it is the nature of building against five sandboxes — so the useful thing is to know in advance which decisions absorb change cheaply and which ones hurt.

**Seams built specifically to absorb it.** Each of these exists because something downstream is likely to change:

- `FileAccess` — path today, security-scoped bookmark if we sandbox. Isolates the single most likely architectural reversal.
- `HostEnvironment` — storage roots and preference domains; the App Group identifier it once held was deleted. Every platform difference and every container surprise lands here rather than in the kit.
- The source-provider protocol — enumerate and materialize, plus the existence and availability questions a source must answer. New source kinds are additive.
- The pool API and the queue — a new surface is a new consumer row, and a new source kind is a new provider. Neither reaches into the other.
- The migrator — schema change is a routine operation with a test, not an event to be feared. This is what makes "add a nullable column later" a real answer rather than a hopeful one.
- The transport seam — a consumer reaches the deck through an interface, so one consumer falling back to a journal or an HTTP call does not disturb the others.

**Cheap to revisit later.** Cross-device sync is additive — a nullable identity column and a sync table. Deduplication is additive in the same way. Display modes are new cases in an existing enum. The cache cap and the repeat window are already configuration. Rename-and-move tracking is a column plus a resolver.

**Expensive to revisit, so worth being deliberate about now.** The shared queue versus per-surface queues is a semantic change that reaches the schema and every surface's expectations — it is the decision most worth being sure about. Sandboxing the Mac app is expensive not in code, thanks to `FileAccess`, but in consequence: it changes how the screensaver is delivered and may push wallpaper toward materializing everything. And SQLite itself is effectively permanent, which is fine, because nothing about it is likely to disappoint.

**What that means for this document.** It gets edited as the sequence proceeds rather than written once. A phase that forces a reversal should have the reversal recorded here — in Design Decisions if it changes a decision, in this section if it changes what we thought was safe to assume.

## What changed on the Mac since 2014

Orientation, limited to what actually touches this project. The last external Mac work here predates most of it.

**Distribution is no longer optional ceremony.**

- **Notarization (2019) is mandatory** for Developer ID distribution. Gatekeeper refuses an unnotarized app with a "damaged" error that tells the user nothing. The pipeline is `xcrun notarytool submit` — `altool` was retired in 2021 — followed by `xcrun stapler staple` on both the app and the DMG.
- **Hardened Runtime (2018) is a prerequisite** for notarization, and it means opting back in, via entitlement, to anything it blocks.
- **A paid Developer Program membership is effectively required** to distribute anything at all outside the App Store. In 2014 you could get away without one.
- **Universal binaries** again, arm64 plus x86_64, though for a machine-local project arm64-only is defensible.

**The privacy system did not exist in this form.** Covered separately below — it is the item most likely to bite.

**Things that got better and remove work:**

- `SMAppService` (macOS 13) replaced hand-installed launchd plists and the deprecated `SMLoginItemSetEnabled`. This is what removes the installer. **Not the route taken, 2026-09-10:** the agent installs as a per-user plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` — see *An installer is probably unnecessary*.
- Swift ABI stability (2019) means no Swift runtime is embedded in a `.saver` or anywhere else.
- SwiftUI exists, and on the Mac is now genuinely usable for something like this.
- Swift concurrency and, since Swift 6, strict concurrency checking — which is why the kit's API is designed around it rather than around `dispatch_queue_t`.
- Swift Package Manager is the normal way to structure shared code, replacing what would have been a framework target.

**Things that got worse, or at least stranger:**

- Screen savers no longer run in their own process. They are loaded into `legacyScreenSaver`, and inherit its sandbox. This is the single biggest change affecting the plan, and the reason Phase 6 opens with a spike.
- System Settings replaced System Preferences (Ventura), and the wallpaper and screensaver panes were merged and reworked (Sonoma). Anything remembered about how those panes behave is suspect.
- Widgets arrived on the Mac (Big Sur, then on the desktop in Sonoma) — an opportunity rather than a problem, but a whole surface that did not exist.

## Identifiers

`com.sydpolk.photosgoround` is the root, and everything hangs off it. *Renamed 2026-09-22 from `com.sydpolk.photogoround`. Debug and Claude builds add `.debug` or `.claude` to the saver's and the wallpaper's; the app and the agent keep one identifier across all three, because TCC grants hang off it — `BuildVariant.swift`.*

| Thing | Identifier |
| --- | --- |
| Mac app | `com.sydpolk.photosgoround` |
| Server (agent) | `com.sydpolk.photosgoround.server` |
| Mac widget extension | `com.sydpolk.photosgoround.widget` |
| Screensaver | `com.sydpolk.photosgoround.saver` |
| Wallpaper extension | `com.sydpolk.photosgoround.wallpaper.extension` |
| iOS app / widget | `com.sydpolk.photosgoround` / `.widget` |
| watchOS app | `com.sydpolk.photosgoround.watchkitapp` |
| Swift module | `PhotosGoRoundKit` |
| Saver principal class | `@objc(PGRScreenSaverView)` |

Two identifiers are not free choices and are worth writing down before they cause an afternoon of confusion:

- **The App Group must be team-ID prefixed on macOS**: `<TeamID>.com.sydpolk.photosgoround`, not `group.com.sydpolk.photosgoround`. This differs from the iOS convention, and getting it wrong produces a `nil` container URL rather than an error. It also means the group identifier is not shared between the Mac and iOS builds, so it belongs in `HostEnvironment` rather than in a shared constant. **No App Group is used as built**; the spelling is kept for the day a widget or a sandbox needs one.
- ~~**The preferences domain is the group, not the bundle.**~~ **Corrected 2026-09-12: it is the bundle.** Settings and the source list live in `com.sydpolk.photosgoround[.debug|.claude]` — `.dev` in development until 2026-09-24 — which is exactly what `defaults write com.sydpolk.photosgoround …` reaches, so the collision below does not arise. `pgr_ctl set <key> <value>` is the blessed writer from a terminal, because it knows the domain and rings the doorbell; it is not the only writer — the agent writes the source list on a client's behalf, and the app writes the wallpaper's own domains — and the screensaver has no settings domain. What follows is the design this replaced. Settings shared between the server, the app, and the widget live in the App Group's `UserDefaults` suite, whose backing store is inside `~/Library/Group Containers/`. That collides with the requirement that everything be settable from the command line, because `defaults write com.sydpolk.photogoround …` would write to the wrong place entirely and appear to do nothing.

  Hence a firm rule: **`pgr_ctl` owns preference writes.** It knows the correct domain for each consumer — the group suite for shared settings, and the `legacyScreenSaver` container's own domain for screensaver settings, which is a third location again. The command line requirement is satisfied by `pgr_ctl set <key> <value>`, not by raw `defaults`, and `pgr_ctl` posts the Darwin notification afterwards so the change takes effect immediately. Raw `defaults` remains usable by anyone who knows the right domain, but nothing depends on them knowing it.

## TCC: unsandboxed does not mean unrestricted

This corrects something stated too simply earlier in this plan. "Unsandboxed, so arbitrary folder access is straightforward" was true in 2014 and is not true now.

Since Catalina, **even an unsandboxed app needs user consent** to read `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, `~/Downloads`, iCloud Drive, removable volumes, and network volumes. The first access triggers a prompt attributed to the requesting application; denial is remembered, and the failure afterwards is a plain permission error rather than anything self-explanatory. Photos access is a separate consent again, with its own prompt and its own entry in Settings.

Three consequences for the design:

- **Consent is keyed to a code-signing identity, so two bundles mean two prompts.** The app and the agent are separate bundles with separate identities, and would each need their own Photos grant and their own Files-and-Folders grant — the user consenting twice to the same thing, with the second prompt arriving from a process they cannot see.

  The server architecture already solves this, and it is worth naming as a benefit rather than leaving as an accident: **only the server ever touches files or the Photos library.** The app is a window that reads the deck and displays cards; it opens no photo and enumerates no folder. One bundle holds every privacy grant, prompts once, and appears exactly once in each Settings list.
- **A headless agent prompting is bad ergonomics.** A TCC dialog attributed to a background process with no window, possibly minutes after the user did anything, is confusing. So `pgr_ctl` and the app should both be able to trigger the server's first access *on demand*, at a moment the user is looking at the screen and has just asked for the folder to be added — the prompt then arrives in context even though it names the server.
- **Full Disk Access is the escape hatch, not the design.** Granting it in Settings sidesteps every folder prompt at once, and is a perfectly reasonable thing to do on a personal machine. It should never be a requirement, and the software should work correctly without it, prompting per-folder as needed.

Adding this to the entitlements ledger: the server carries `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` and needs Files-and-Folders consent; the app and `pgr_ctl` ideally carry neither, because they never touch either resource. **As built**: the app carries neither; `pgr_ctl` carries `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`, because `photos-spike` and `sources add --album` reach Photos, and it walks folders itself.

## Shipping it: 1.0 distribution and updates

A 1.0 concern only. 0.1 runs from Xcode. **Notarized builds work since 2026-09-23**: the Developer ID Application certificate for team R5PQPZARC5 and the `pgr-notary` profile are in Syd's keychain, and a notarized Release installed in `/Applications` runs production.

### An installer is probably unnecessary

The instinct that a LaunchAgent needs an installer is a correct instinct about the old world. `SMAppService.agent(plistName:)` was introduced precisely to end it: the agent's plist lives inside the app bundle at `Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/`, the app registers it with one call, and the user sees and controls it in System Settings → General → Login Items. No `launchctl`, no writing to `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, no privileged install step, and — importantly — no uninstaller to write, since unregistering is also one call and deleting the app is most of the story.

**Corrected 2026-09-10: the agent installs as a per-user plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`.** Syd: "the agent MUST be installed in ~/Library/LaunchAgents; this needs to support multiple users on the same machine" — "at least the database and plist", and "the binary stays in the app bundle." So the app writes the plist and bootstraps it with `launchctl` for whoever is logged in — exactly what the paragraph above argued `SMAppService` removed; it is kept because it is what was weighed. It still needs no installer: each user's first launch of the app installs that user's plist. Uninstalling becomes a step to design rather than one call.

So the pieces resolve like this:

- **The app** ships in a notarized, stapled DMG. Drag to `/Applications`. **`Scripts/release-build.sh` makes it**, Syd's to run. It archives Release, exports it with Developer ID, checks every bundle for the Developer ID signature and the hardened runtime and the app and agent for the Photos entitlement, then notarizes and staples the app, and then the DMG. It needs a Developer ID Application certificate and a `notarytool` keychain profile, `pgr-notary`, once per Mac. *Written 2026-09-23, when neither existed; both are in Syd's keychain since.* Organizer's *Direct Distribution* makes the same notarized app without the DMG, and made the first one. The DMG is plain today; TODO.md, *A finished DMG*, is what it should become, and it is next; planned in `Release DMG.md`.
- **The agent** registers itself on first launch via `SMAppService`. Nothing to install. **Corrected 2026-09-10:** the app installs the user's plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` on first launch, as above. **As built, 2026-09-21**: every launch, in every build, installs the agent if it is not there and restarts it; the plist points at the agent inside the app bundle. `Release App Installer.md`.
- **The wallpaper extension** is registered from inside the app bundle, where it sits, by a Release launch when it is not registered. *Added 2026-09-27; built 2026-09-21, `Release App Installer.md`.*
- **The screensaver** is the one piece that genuinely needs placing, into `~/Library/Screen Savers/`. Unsandboxed, the app can simply copy it there itself, which is better than making the user find and double-click a `.saver`. **As built, 2026-09-21: not a copy but a symlink** into the app bundle, laid down by a Release launch when nothing is at its name. If we ever sandbox, this stops being possible and the saver ships as a separate download — which is already noted as one of the costs of sandboxing.

A `.pkg` installer buys only two things we do not need: installing for all users, and having the agent running before the app is ever launched. Against that it costs a second signing and notarization pipeline, a receipt to reason about, and an uninstall story. Worth revisiting only if the DMG route turns out to trip on something concrete.

### Updates, and the Sparkle problem

Not being in the App Store means no update mechanism comes for free, and Sparkle is the obvious answer — it is the de facto standard for Developer ID Mac apps, it is well built, and it handles EdDSA-signed appcasts, delta updates, and atomic replacement correctly.

It is also a third-party dependency, which collides directly with the rule that the only things outside our own code are Apple's frameworks and the photo libraries. That collision should be resolved deliberately rather than by reflex in either direction, because both reflexes are wrong here:

- **Reflex one: take Sparkle, it is standard.** Reasonable, but it is a large framework that runs privileged-ish code paths, and it is the single largest thing we would ever link.
- **Reflex two: hand-roll it, we hand-roll everything else.** This is the one place where the no-dependencies instinct is dangerous. An updater downloads and executes code. Getting signature verification, replacement atomicity, and quarantine handling right is security-critical work in a way that a SQLite wrapper is not — a bug in the migrator loses data, a bug in the updater runs someone else's binary.

**The third option is the recommended one: do not auto-update at all.** A "check for updates" that fetches a small JSON file from the GitHub releases API, compares versions, and — if newer — shows a notice and opens the release page in the browser. The user downloads the DMG and drags it over, exactly as they installed it. That is perhaps fifty lines, has no dependency, and has no security surface whatsoever, because we never download or execute anything: we open a URL.

For an application with a user base of one, that is not a compromise, it is the correct engineering. If it ever ships to strangers who will not tolerate manual updates, Sparkle becomes the deliberate exception, taken with eyes open and documented here as such.

### A changelog, once there are public releases

Syd, 2026-09-22: "If I ever have public betas and releases, I will start maintaining a CHANGELOG.md file." Until then there is none, and git history is the record.

## Beyond 0.1

Everything in the phase list is 0.1. The display richness below is held back deliberately, so that 0.1 ships one fit, one layout, one transition, and gets used.

### Can we reuse Apple's screensaver transitions?

No. `ScreenSaverView`'s public API contains no transition library at all — it gives you a view, a timer, and nothing else. The transitions people admire in Apple's photo screensavers (Ken Burns, Shifting Tiles, Sliding Panels, Vintage Prints) live in private frameworks of the `iLifeSlideshow` family. Linking against those is not shippable and would break without warning.

There was one supported way to get them anyway — maintain a folder of full-resolution photos and point Apple's built-in photo screensaver at it — and it is rejected on principle rather than on mechanics. See *Alternatives considered and rejected*: we control the content, entirely, or the project has given away the thing it exists to do.

So we write our own `.saver`, and its transitions are ours. That is why Phase 6 stays, sandbox spike and all.

The upside of owning it is that the transition list can start at one. A cross-fade is enough for 0.1 — the pan already supplies most of the motion, and every photo screensaver worth watching is mostly cross-fade anyway. Ken Burns, slides, and tiled collages come later, as items in an enum, tuned in the Mac app's full-screen window where a debugger works.

### Features versus architecture

A rough guide to how much work an item is, and nothing stronger. **This used to be a rule** — *nothing in this section may require a change below the display layer* — and the rule is gone. It was drawn before there was anything running to check it against, and the first item that failed it (retracting a photo already on screen) failed on a technicality while being obviously the right thing to defer. A prohibition that has to be argued around on its first real case is not carrying its weight.

**What made the rule seem necessary was a wire, and there is no wire.** A protocol frozen for clients you cannot change is worth defending that hard; `/v1/next` has no such clients. Every one is on this machine, in this repository, built and shipped in the same breath as the service — see *Every device serves itself, so the service never leaves the machine*. Adding a parameter or an endpoint means editing both ends and rebuilding, which is an afternoon rather than a compatibility problem. The `/v1` in the path stays as cheap insurance, not as a promise anybody is holding us to. The insurance has been used once: `/v2/sources` and `/v2/photos` sit beside `/v1`.

**Architecture — the first instance of a new class of surface.** The first widget is real work: App Group container resolution across a sandbox boundary, timeline budgets, the memory ceiling, writing small files for an outstanding hand. The first `.saver` is real work: someone else's sandbox, and a transport that may not be the database. Those earn phases.

**Features — every instance after the first.** Once widgets work, more widgets are sizes and layouts. Small, medium, large, Lock Screen, Notification Center, desktop, Smart Stack — each is a new `WidgetFamily` case, a SwiftUI view, and a consumer row. No new mechanism, nothing below the display layer touched. The same is true of display styles: a new fit, a new transition, a tiled layout, a collage is an enum case plus a renderer that receives a decoded image and a rectangle. And of sources: once the provider protocol exists, a new source kind is a provider, which is why Google Photos is a late phase only because of its OAuth flow, not because of anything structural.

**Reaching below the display layer is a size estimate, not a disqualification.** Some items here do it. Retracting a photo already on screen needs an endpoint and a notification topic — a small thing when both ends ship together. Video needs per-consumer filtering in the deal query, which is a large thing, and is why it is a 2.0 item rather than an entry in a transitions list. The estimate tells you what an item costs before you start it. It does not tell you whether to start it, and it does not promote it to a phase on its own.

The practical consequence is that this whole section is safe to defer indefinitely and safe to pick from in any order, one item at a time, whenever one sounds fun. **If one turns out to want work underneath, that is a thing to find out by building it**, and to write down here afterwards — which is how everything else in this plan has been decided.

### Deferred: retracting a photo already on screen

Deferred here rather than built into 0.1: a payload-free `.photoRevoked` topic plus `GET /v1/revocations?since=<cursor>`, so a surface holding a deleted photo drops it instead of waiting to rotate. Worked out in full under *Revocation, and the staleness that is accepted*; the reason it waits is that whether a picture vanishing under a viewer reads better or worse than one that lingers is a question you answer by watching it happen.

It reaches below the display layer — an endpoint and a notification topic — which is a note on what it costs rather than a reason it does not belong here.

### TODO: separate pools of sources, exposed to the client

Added 2026-09-05. We are going to want separate pools of sources exposed to the client. Each pool would have a subset of the total sources available. They would all share the same cache on the agent. This will allow having separate pools for the screensaver and for wallpapers, and would allow showing previews on the client, adding and removing sources.

### TODO: a wedged Photos library freezes the agent

Added 2026-09-06, from a Mac that is underprovisioned for the job. Photos has been syncing with iCloud for more than a day, every call into it hangs rather than failing, and anything in the agent that touches it stops with it. The agent is not slow, it is stopped.

**Largely built since, as of 2026-09-12.** `BoundedPhotoLibrary` bounds every PhotoKit call — ten seconds for metadata, sixty for a fetch, two minutes for the consent prompt, and silence between assets during a walk — and a timeout reads as `.unknown` from `existence` and `.offline` from `availability`, which the offline path already serves through. The refresh walk runs off the heartbeat tick. So the first of the two directions below is what was built, and when the deleted-photo guarantee cannot be checked, the copy we hold goes out with the reason on the served line. What stays open is a Photos walk inside a refresh taking up to ten seconds per gap between assets. *2026-09-23:* the first gap is sixty seconds, because a library cold from boot took more than ten to start a walk, and an album that goes unanswered is walked again after thirty seconds rather than at the next scan. `Startup Performance.md`.

**A hang is not a failure, and nothing here is built for it.** `SourceBench` exists precisely for a source that stops answering, but it is driven by fetches that *return* an error; work that never returns never trips it. `CacheSettings.libraryFetchLimit` bounds a materialize at 60 seconds, so the fetch path is the one place already covered. Three places are not:

- ~~**`serve` awaits `provider.existence(of:in:)` on the request path, with no deadline**~~ *Bounded since 2026-09-16:* the check, and the availability question after it, share `ServiceTiming.serveCheckBudget`, one second per request, and running out is *unknown*, so the held copy goes out. Photos stopped answering at 12:15 that day and a cached picture took 21 s to serve against a five-second client; it takes 1.1 s now. `SilentLibraryServingTests`. Kept as written below: — the *is it still there?* check that makes the deleted-photo guarantee. It calls `library.authorization` and `library.assetExists`, both PhotoKit, and it is the last thing between a card and a 200. A wedged library therefore hangs `GET /v1/next` itself rather than costing a skip, which is the opposite of every other failure on that path.
- **The refresh walk runs inside the heartbeat tick**, so `enumerate` on a Photos source blocks the preference re-read behind it — *and blocked eviction too, until eviction left the tick on 2026-09-16.* This document already records that shape costing 30.9 seconds on a network share; a hang makes it unbounded.
- **`availability(of:)`** is on the same footing as the two above.

Worth measuring before designing anything. Whether these calls hang indefinitely or eventually return; whether `PHPhotoLibrary.authorizationStatus` hangs too, since it is the cheap gate everything else sits behind; and whether the system offers any way to ask *is this library usable right now* that is itself bounded. Two directions suggest themselves and neither is decided: a deadline around every provider call rather than around fetches alone, treating a timeout as `.unknown` — which the offline path already knows how to serve through — or letting the bench be tripped by silence as well as by errors. The first looks smaller and more honest; it also means deciding what a `serve` does when the guarantee cannot be checked, which is a promise this plan makes deliberately and should not weaken by accident.

**It is not specific to a bad machine.** The provisioning is what made it constant and therefore visible; a first sync after a restore, a large import, or a slow network reaches the same state on any Mac for a shorter while.

### TODO: pulling originals fills the startup volume

Added 2026-09-05. On a laptop set to Optimize Mac Storage, every asset the deck touches makes Photos download the full original from iCloud, and the system reclaims that purgeable space slowly enough that the startup volume fills. The renderer discards those pixels anyway — it subsamples to the client's box — so the originals are being pulled to be thrown away.

Worth measuring whether `PHImageManager.requestImage` at the display box, with `isNetworkAccessAllowed = false`, is served from Photos' local derivative rather than triggering a download, and what resolution those derivatives actually are: one smaller than the display box is what would make this a bad trade. The same call returns promptly with `PHImageResultIsInCloudKey` when it cannot be served locally, which is the fast local-availability test `photos-spike` went looking for and did not find — enough to prefer assets already on disk and rate-limit the rest.

It reverses the reasoning that put `PHAssetResourceManager` in the kit, so it wants numbers before design. On a Mac set to download originals nothing changes: everything is already local and the same request always wins.

**A preference and a checkbox, whichever way the measurement goes.** Whether Photos is asked for the full-resolution original or left to hand over whatever derivative it already has locally is a choice about somebody's disk, and the right answer differs between a Mac mini with the whole library downloaded and a laptop on Optimize Mac Storage. So it is a setting in the agent's preference domain alongside the other cache preferences, and a checkbox in the Mac app's source settings beside the Photos collections — not a constant picked once here. The measurement above decides the default, not whether the option exists.

### TODO: an app icon

Added 2026-09-06. There is no icon anywhere — no asset catalog, no `.icns`, no `CFBundleIcon` key in the agent bundle or the Mac app — so both run with the generic placeholder.

Two surfaces need one and they are not the same job. The Mac app's is the ordinary case: Dock, ⌘-Tab, Finder. The agent's matters more than a headless process suggests, because it appears in System Settings → Login Items — through `SMAppService` as first written, or under *Allow in the Background* as the per-user plist decided on 2026-09-10 — which is exactly where somebody decides whether to trust a background item that starts itself — and a generic icon there reads as something that arrived without being asked. The phases add iOS, tvOS, and watchOS later; whatever is drawn should survive being shrunk to a watch.

### Display styles

Per-surface, and different for the screensaver and the wallpaper, since a photo you look at for two seconds and one you look at for an hour want different treatment:

- **Fits** beyond shrink-or-expand: fill and crop, center at native size, and an upscale cap that stops a small photo from being enlarged into mush.
- **Aspect-ratio handling** for the letterbox: pure black today; blurred-and-scaled fill of the photo itself, or a color sampled from the image, later.
- **Tiling**, for small images and for deliberately patterned wallpaper.
- **Multi-photo layouts** on the screensaver — the collage and grid arrangements that make Apple's versions pleasant.

### Timing and transitions

If we do write our own saver: dwell time, transition style, transition duration, pan speed and whether to pan at all, and cycle time — each per surface, since the wallpaper's half hour and the screensaver's ten seconds are unrelated numbers.

### Everything user-settable is a user default

All consumer-facing settings live in `UserDefaults`, in the agent's preference domain, not in the database, so that `defaults write` is a first-class interface on the Mac rather than an escape hatch. This is a refinement of the earlier "config in the database" decision, and the split is clean: **the database holds state — sources, deck, cache, queue; `UserDefaults` holds preferences — fits, timings, transitions, caps.** State is what the system knows; preferences are what you told it. **One exception, 2026-09-10:** the wallpaper keeps state — the time each display last changed — in `UserDefaults`, in domains of its own (`com.sydpolk.photosgoround[.debug|.claude].wallpaper`; `.wallpaper.{dev|prod}` until 2026-09-24), because the database is private to the agent and the agent's domain is not the wallpaper's to write. Syd: "the agent won't care about this preference." See `Wallpaper Plan.md`, *The time each display last changed*.

Two things to get right:

- **A Darwin notification still does the waking.** `UserDefaults` change observation is unreliable across process boundaries, so a writer posts a notification and readers re-read. `pgr_ctl` posts it after any write, so `defaults write` followed by `pgr_ctl notify prefs` takes effect immediately rather than at the next poll.
- **The screensaver's preference domain is not where you think it is.** A `.saver` running sandboxed inside `legacyScreenSaver` reads preferences from that host's container, not from `~/Library/Preferences/`. `ScreenSaverDefaults(forModuleWithName:)` exists to handle exactly this, and it means a plain `defaults write` from the terminal will appear to do nothing to screensaver settings until it is aimed at the right domain. Worth a `pgr_ctl` subcommand that writes to the correct place so the right path is discovered once rather than every time. **As built the saver has no settings**, so there is nothing to aim at; it reads the agent's own plist file for the port, since its sandbox hands it an empty suite.

## Alternatives considered and rejected

- **Core Data with CloudKit sync.** Would give free cross-device sync, but the multi-process constraint kills it on the Mac and the deck logic fights the object graph.
- **Writing the core in C or C++.** You floated this. It would be portable beyond Apple platforms, but every consumer here is Swift, the Photos and WidgetKit APIs are Swift-or-Objective-C anyway, and Swift 6 concurrency is a better fit for the fetch pipeline than hand-rolled threading. Reconsider only if a Linux or Windows surface ever matters. *Closed for C++ 2026-09-15 — Syd: "We will never voluntarily use C++"; see* Builds with no warnings: no C++, and schemes rather than targets.
- **A single monolithic app with no agent.** Simpler, but nothing updates the deck when the app is not running, and the screensaver would have no data source. The agent is what makes the wallpaper schedule real. **Corrected 2026-09-10:** only in that it serves the pictures; the wallpaper's schedule is its own, run by the app and later by a binary of its own.
- **A directory watcher on the preferences plist.** Replaced by a thirty-second poll. `defaults` writes through `cfprefsd`, which replaces the plist atomically via rename, so a vnode source has to be re-armed on every replace or it silently stops working after the first write — a whole class of bug, bought in exchange for latency nobody can perceive on a dwell time or a cache cap. `pgr_ctl set` rings the doorbell anyway, so the blessed path is still instant.
- **Watching folder sources — rejected for 0.1, then reinstated for 1.0.** Worth recording as a reversal rather than quietly amending, because the reasoning changed rather than the facts. Rescanning was measured and is genuinely free (2.4 seconds per twenty thousand photos, invisible to a concurrent consumer), so watching bought only latency and was cut. It came back when the never-show-a-deleted-photo requirement arrived from a different direction entirely: the play-time existence check protects on-demand surfaces completely, and pre-rendered ones not at all. See *Watching, and why it comes back for 1.0*.
- **Reusing Apple's screensaver by feeding it an album.** Considered and dismissed: you cannot control its download behavior, which is the actual bug being worked around.
- **Reusing Apple's screensaver by feeding it a *folder* we maintain.** A much stronger version of the above, and genuinely tempting. The server would keep a directory of full-resolution photos and point the built-in photo screensaver at it — Apple renders, we curate. It would have dissolved the hardest problem in the plan: no `.saver` bundle, so no `legacyScreenSaver` sandbox, no container-path archaeology, no consumption journal, no Phase 6 spike. It even fit the consumer model cleanly, since a folder is just a hand made of files. The user-picks-a-file problem it creates was solvable too, by rotating *contents* behind fixed slot filenames — `slot-001.heic` and friends, overwritten in place — so a reference never breaks and only the picture changes.

  Rejected anyway, and for the reason that outranks all of that: **we are the complete controllers of the content.** Handing the folder to Apple gives away ordering, timing, and which photos actually appear, and returns no feedback about what was shown — so the deck cannot honestly advance, and the shuffle we went to all this trouble to build stops being the thing on screen. Every mitigation above is a workaround for having ceded control that we should not have ceded. Owning the saver costs a sandbox spike and a cross-fade; it buys the entire point of the project.

  It also fails on its own mechanical terms, which is worth recording separately from the principle. Apple's screensaver selection GUI chokes on folders containing large numbers of pictures — one of the original motivations for this project — so the approach depends on the very component already known to be broken. The slot design happens to dodge it, since a few hundred fixed slots stay small no matter how large the library behind them grows, but relying on a workaround to stay inside the limits of a UI that already fails at this exact task is not a foundation.

  Kept here in full, mechanics and all, because it is the standing contingency: if the Phase 6 spike shows a saver cannot reach the deck by any of the four mechanisms and the consumption journal turns out unworkable, this is the fallback that still puts full-resolution shuffled photos on the screen. Worse, but not nothing, and already designed.
- **The database as the transport for pictures, not just for control.** This was the design until Phase 1.5, and it is written up in full under *The service is the interface*, along with the four alternatives killed alongside it — a two-phase download over Server-Sent Events, a Node service, a C core, and running the service in AWS. The short form: sharing SQLite works beautifully between a command-line tool and an agent on one machine, and fails on every surface that is the point of the project, because it requires each sandboxed client to obtain file access to the container and the cache, and cannot reach a Watch or an Apple TV at all.
- **A real local cache on the Watch.** Technically possible — carve out space and keep a proper rolling library on-device. Declined, because it buys less than it appears to: the Watch still has no sources, so a bigger cache still has to be filled by the phone. All the extra storage purchases is more variety while out of range of the phone, in exchange for a second cache with its own eviction policy on the most storage-constrained device in the lineup. The small rolling set stays.

  One argument *against* it that does not hold, recorded so it does not get re-invented: that it would force us to down-convert images to the watch's resolution when we do not have to anywhere else. Down-conversion happens everywhere — it is what a subsampled decode to display size *is*, on every platform, for every photo. The watch's copies are produced on the *phone* in either design, so a local watch cache would add no new kind of work and move no resizing onto the watch. The reason above is the real one.
