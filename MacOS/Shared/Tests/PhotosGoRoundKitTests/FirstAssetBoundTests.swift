/// after a reboot, a cold `photolibraryd` took more than the ten-second gap
/// bound to produce the first asset of either album, and both went dark for
/// five minutes. See `BoundedPhotoLibrary.firstAssetLimit`.

/// by a minute, far above anything a loaded machine adds; the silent one never
/// answers, so the only outcome is the bound firing.
