/// A Photos album that stops resolving while the library stays readable.
///
/// **This is the 2026-09-07 rebuild, replayed.** Photos rebuilt its library and
/// renumbered two albums, and with them every asset identifier inside. Nothing
/// was deleted; the identifiers we hold simply name nothing any more. The rule
/// is that an album which is not there says nothing about its photographs: what
/// the cache holds keeps being served, and no row goes until the person acts.
/// See `Missing Albums Plan.md`.
///
/// The rebuild is played against the database rather than the fake library,
/// because that is exactly what a rebuild looks like from the agent's side —
/// the library moved on and the rows describe a world that is gone.
