/// Serving pictures while a large Photos album is being re-read.
///
/// **Measured 2026-09-16.** The agent's launch refresh re-read Favorites — 8,547
/// photographs, nothing added or removed — in 73 seconds, and for that whole
/// time `/v1/next` took 10 to 50 seconds against a client that gives up at
/// five. The agent before it did the same during its scheduled refresh at
/// 13:12. Before and after, the same requests took 150–700 ms.
///
/// **Two connections, the way the agent has them.** The refresh opens its own
/// `Database` in its own task, as `RunCommand.refreshSources` does, and each
/// request opens another and does what `PictureEndpoint.next` does to the
/// database: register the consumer, serve, mark the card delivered.
///
/// **This passes, and that is a finding, not a fix.** Written to reproduce the
/// stall, it did not: the re-read took 0.24 s and the slowest request 12 ms.
/// A walk that also blocked a thread for 430 ms per 500 photographs, as
/// `SystemPhotoLibrary.Album` does, took 8.8 s and its slowest request 5 ms.
/// So two connections sharing the writer is not enough on its own. The
/// endpoint's `TIMING:` line was added the same day to say what is.
