/// **Measured 2026-09-16.** `photolibraryd` stopped answering the agent at about
/// 12:15 and every question — `authorization`, `title`, `assetExists` — waited
/// out its ten-second bound. Serving asks those questions about the one card
/// going out, so a request whose head card was a Photos photograph took tens of
/// seconds (one took 58) against a client that gives up at five. The app and the
/// screensaver both said *the agent on 52133 said nothing within 5 seconds*,
/// about an agent holding hundreds of cached pictures it could have shown.
///
/// The bounds here are the agent's own, not shortened ones, because the fault is
/// the relationship between them and the client's.
