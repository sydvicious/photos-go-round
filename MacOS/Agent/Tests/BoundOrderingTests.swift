/// **The measured fault, 2026-09-07.** Against a photo library that had stopped
/// answering, the agent replied at 10.0–10.7 seconds and the Mac app gave up at
/// exactly 10.0 — every time, for twenty minutes of log. So the agent's own
/// sentence, *the photo library did not answer collections*, never reached
/// anybody; the panel said *the agent is not answering* about an agent that was
/// answering perfectly and naming the real culprit.
///
/// **Two bounds that equal each other are a race the outer one always loses**,
/// because it starts first and pays the request's overhead as well. These pin
/// the ordering so a later edit to any one number cannot quietly close the gap
/// again — nothing else in the system would notice, and the symptom is a
/// sentence blaming the wrong machine.
