# Summary

The Mac app's own features — what the window gains beyond showing a photograph. Subordinate to `PLAN.md`, which plans the system.

# Rationale

`PLAN.md` plans a system: a library, a service, and a sequence of surfaces that consume it. The app accumulates features that live entirely inside its window and matter to nothing else, and threading each through the phase list would bury the shape of the project under interface detail. They also arrive on their own cadence — the app is the only place a person touches any of this, so it grows whenever using it makes an absence obvious rather than when a phase says so.

Building the first of them forced a decision that is **not** app-specific: the database became private to the service, and a client asks it over HTTP rather than reading the store. That lives in `PLAN.md` under *The database is private to the service*, because it governs the screensaver, the widgets, and iOS as much as this window. The first deliverable below is that work; the rest is the app.

# Phases

- *Web services for managing sources* — **done.** The agent answers, so a client never opens the store.
  - `GET /v1/sources` — the list, with photo count, availability, reason, and the source's `uuid`.
  - `POST /v1/sources` — add an array, all or none; returns what was created.
  - `GET /v1/sources/<uuid>` — one source, with the options it was added with.
  - `PATCH /v1/sources/<uuid>` — change one of those options; today that is `recursive`.
  - `DELETE /v1/sources/<uuid>` — remove one.
  - `POST /v2/sources/<uuid>/reconnect` — point a missing Photos album at its one successor. See *Missing Photos albums* below.
  - `pgr_ctl` is unchanged: it keeps preferences and the database, and never makes a web request. Command-line HTTP is `curl`.
- *Sources in Settings* — **done**, and to be superseded in shape by *Sources by kind, in sections* below, which is not built. One panel that shows what is configured and changes it.
  - A list with icon, name, count, and state; path secondary.
  - `Add Picture Files…` — files only, multiple selection, one source per file.
  - `Add Picture Folder…` — one at a time, with an "Add contents of contained folders" checkbox.
  - **Two panels as of 2026-08-26**: *Apple Photos* on top, *Folders and Files* below enclosing everything above. See *Two panels, because there is one Photos library*.
  - `Select Collections…` in the upper panel — present and disabled, replacing the `Add from Photos Library…` menu item. The provider exists and `pgr_ctl sources add --album` works; what is missing is the picker, Phase 5 of `Apple Photos Plan.md`. **Enabled since 2026-08-26:** the picker is *Choosing Photos collections* below.
  - Remove a selected source.
  - Configure a selected folder — the button, the context menu, or a double-click — showing the full path and the one option it has.
  - The list is re-read when the panel appears, and every minute while it is open; a read that fails tries again in fifteen seconds.
- *Choosing Photos collections* — **done 2026-08-26.** `Select Collections…` opens a picker over the agent's `/v2/photos/albums`.
  - Its own resizable `Window`, not a sheet: several hundred rows have to be resizable and a macOS sheet is not.
  - An outline of Photos' four sections, with folders nested inside them and albums under the folder that holds them.
  - A checkbox per album; three-state checkboxes on folders, which are never sources themselves.
  - Favorites pinned above the headings, in the heading's weight.
  - Counts arrive as the agent counts — absent is not zero, and the footer says `Counting 343 of 439…` so blanks are explained.
  - The unauthorized state lives here: an Allow button while undecided, a pointer to System Settings after.
  - Done applies it: one `POST` for what was ticked, a `DELETE` each for what was unticked, adds first.
- *Missing Photos albums* — **done 2026-09-07**, planned in `Missing Albums Plan.md`. An album that stops resolving is not deleted a photograph at a time.
  - It leaves the chosen-collections line and is listed by name beneath it: "There are missing albums: *name*, *name*. Do you want to remove these references?"
  - Remove deletes every listed source; Reconnect points each album that has exactly one match at it, keeping the source. One spinner and one lockout, as for every change.
- *Navigation in the picture window* — say "next" by hand. **Not built.**
  - Chevron on hover at the right edge; keys: space, →, ↓, page down.
  - One rule: no request sooner than `advanceIntervalSeconds` after the current picture was drawn.
- *The picture's title under it* — **Not built, and not designed.** Syd, 2026-09-19: "show the title of the file underneath the image if there is one set; otherwise render it as before", and "photos asset 'Title'. actually, 'Caption', or 'Title', in that order."
  - A photograph with one gets it beneath the image; one without is drawn exactly as today. Not the filename, which is always set.
  - **Worth knowing before this is planned: PhotoKit has `caption` and no per-asset title.** `PHAsset.extendedMetadata`, new in macOS 27, carries `caption`, `originalFilename` and `keywords`; every `title` in the Photos headers belongs to a collection, a collection list or a project. *Read from the MacOSX27.0 SDK headers, 2026-09-19.*
  - **The screensaver follows, as an option.** Syd, 2026-09-19: "this will prolly become an option for screensaver eventually." The wallpaper was not mentioned.
- *Sources by kind, in sections* — replaces the single list, and settles what to do about a two-hundred-file selection. **Not built.** The lower panel is still one list, with a `+` menu offering files or a folder.
  - A "Files" section and a "Folders" section, each with its own `+` and `−` beneath it, each showing five rows before it scrolls.
  - `+` is that kind's picker, so the menu that chooses a kind goes away with it.
  - Multiple selection inside a section, ⌘A included, so `−` removes everything selected in one act.
  - **Photos did not wait for this and did not take a section.** It is a panel, because there is one Photos library and never a list of them — see *Two panels, because there is one Photos library*. Google Photos is untouched by that argument and would still be a section here, or a panel of its own.
  - What remains for this phase is Files and Folders, which are genuinely a list of things you add to.
  - **Supersedes collapsing per-file sources into one row.** Sections do the same job — keeping two hundred pinned photographs from being two hundred undifferentiated rows — without inventing the batch identifier the data does not have.
  - Removing several at once wants a batch `DELETE`, or the panel makes a request, a preference write, and a doorbell *per row*. `POST` takes an array for exactly this reason and `DELETE` does not yet.
- *The sources panel resizes* — **done 2026-08-26.** A list that is always the same height is the wrong height twice: once for a single folder, and again for two hundred pinned files.
  - The window resizes in both directions. Vertically for the reason above; horizontally because a row shows its whole path and head-truncates when it will not fit, and because the Apple Photos panel names every collection in play in three lines at most, so width is what decides how many of them can be read.
  - It opens tall enough for what is actually configured, bounded by the screen, rather than opening at a fixed height and being dragged out again on every visit.
  - **This meets *Sources by kind, in sections***, which fixes each section at five rows before it scrolls. Whether the sections divide the available height between them or keep their own count is unsettled, and belongs to whichever of the two is built second.
- *Saying the agent is not there* — **done.** The window title gains the trouble's words — `Photos-Go-Round - Starting…` since 2026-09-26, `Photos-Go-Round - Waiting for Photos` from 2026-09-16 (`Photo-Go-Round - …` until the rename of 2026-09-22), `Photo-Go-Round - Photo-Go-Round Is Not Running` from 2026-09-09, and `Photo-Go-Round - No agent` before that — and the photograph dims behind a flat grey at three-tenths.
  - Nothing is written on the picture: a badge would have to stay legible against whatever is behind it, and `PLAN.md`'s *Showing unavailability* forbids annotating a photograph to report a problem elsewhere. A title has its own background.
  - The picture stays visible rather than being taken down, so what is on screen is still a photograph — veiled, and unmistakably not being replaced.
  - Only for agent trouble — one that cannot be reached, or one that accepted the connection and never answered. An empty queue resolves itself as the agent produces, and a dimmed window every time it ran briefly dry would be noise.
- *The empty state moves* — when there is nothing to show, say so without leaving a still frame on the glass. **Done 2026-09-09**, except the refusal message below, which waits for *The app brings its own agent*.
  - The words drift around the window and bounce off the edges.
  - Slow. The motion is there to keep the pixels from sitting still, not to be looked at.
  - The motion is the same for every empty state; **the words are not.** "No Photos Available" for an empty library, and "Waiting for Photos" for an agent that is missing or stuck — one message for both, at Syd's direction on 2026-09-09. Underneath an empty library is what to do, not what went wrong; the reason stays in the log. Agent trouble has nothing underneath. They were "No photos" and "No agent", with the reason underneath, until 2026-09-09; the agent's was "Photo-Go-Round Is Not Running" over "Open the Photo-Go-Round application to start it." until 2026-09-16, when Syd: "fix the wording. it's stupid." It told you to open the app from inside the app, and once launchd started the agent at login it was wrong everywhere.
  - **Changed 2026-09-26: four sets of words, one line each.** "Starting…" for agent trouble — Syd: "*Waiting for Photos* should be gone"; "Please Add Photos" ("Please add Photos" since 2026-09-27) with no source enabled, when the window also opens Settings, once; "No Photos Available" when there is nothing to show; and nothing underneath any of them — "No secondary lines of text." The agent's `204` says which of the last two it is, so they go up on the first answer; either takes the photograph down at its next change. The words take 80% of the width. `PLAN.md`, *The empty state*.
  - **One exception, and it is narrow**: when registering the agent was *refused*, the window says "Problem launching the agent. Contact support@sydpolk.com." — see *The app brings its own agent*. Anything else with no agent, including one that registered and later stopped, is "Waiting for Photos" — "Starting…" since 2026-09-26.
  - **Built once, in `PhotosGoRoundDisplay`** (`EmptyStateView`, `BouncePath`), and mounted by the window and the screensaver alike. That settles what this bullet used to say — "built here so Phase 6 inherits it" — while `Shuffle` called it Phase 6's, so that neither built it. See `Screensaver Plan.md`, Phase 4.
- *The app brings its own agent* — installing Photos-Go-Round should be the whole of installing Photos-Go-Round. **Not built.**
  - `Photos-Go-Round Server` ships inside the app bundle, with its launchd plist in `Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/`.
  - **Changed 2026-09-10:** the binary stays in the app bundle, and the plist goes in each user's `~/Library/LaunchAgents` instead — "this needs to support multiple users on the same machine." The registering and refusal bullets below were written for `SMAppService` and follow the new route. See `PLAN.md`, *An installer is probably unnecessary*.
  - The app registers and starts it at launch, and does nothing when it is already registered. Mechanism settled in `PLAN.md`, *An installer is probably unnecessary*.
  - Decide which library the embedded agent uses. **Decided 2026-09-24:** the build's own, and each build has exactly one — Syd: "They should be completely separate builds with completely separate assets." A development and a production library inside each build, chosen by `--prod`, went the same day. See `Storage`.
  - Leave a development agent alone if one is already serving on the same preference domain; two agents on one library is the failure this must not cause.
  - Say what happened when registration is refused. It is the one failure that leaves the window with nothing to show and no way for the user to fix it, which is why it is the one that names somewhere to write to: "Problem launching the agent. Contact support@sydpolk.com."
  - **Both went on 2026-09-19.** `Scripts/make-agent-bundle.sh` and `pgr_ctl register` drove `SMAppService`, which needs a plist inside the bundle that only that script wrote. Syd: "Archive for release, command-R for dev." The agent is installed by ⌘R on **Install Agent**, which writes a per-user plist in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`; the app's own way in is still to be designed. `Plans/Xcode - Separate Build and Run.md`, Phase 5.
- *Also set wallpapers* — a checkbox that turned the app's own wallpaper loop on. **Built 2026-09-10, removed 2026-09-16.** Syd, 2026-09-10: "add an option to the app: a checkbox which says 'Also set wallpapers'." Then, once the wallpaper extension was working, "remove the whole in-app loop; we might need it later for sandboxed app, but for now it is gone."
  - While it was ticked, the app ran the wallpaper: a new picture on each display at the *Shuffle All* interval. The loop was `Wallpaper`, in `PhotoGoRoundDisplay`, hosted by `AppDelegate`; it is in git at the commit before its removal.
  - The wallpaper is now the extension, `MacOS/Wallpaper`, turned on by being chosen in System Settings › Wallpaper. The app's Wallpaper panel keeps only the *Shuffle All* pop-up, which sets the extension's interval. See *Time between pictures*.
- *The agent's dashboard, from the About box and Settings* — **built 2026-09-12.** Syd, 2026-09-12: "the reason I want it in the about box is that gives me the port number. it should open the dashboard in the system browser, not a webview in the app."
  - The link's text is the dashboard's URL, port and all. Clicking it opens the default browser, and there is no web view in the app. **A button, not a `Link`, since the service secret went in on 2026-09-23:** a browser cannot send the secret, so a click first asks the agent for a one-time code (`POST /v1/dashboard/code`), and the browser is handed the page with that code, which the agent trades for a cookie. `Plans/Multi-user Support.md`.
  - Re-read every two seconds while the box is open, because the agent takes a new port every launch.
  - With no port published it says "Waiting for Photos", the picture window's words for the same condition until 2026-09-26 — the window says "Starting…" now, and the About box was kept as it is at Syd's word. A preference domain that cannot be read says so, with the reason.
  - The dashboard itself is the agent's: `Documentation/Photos-Go-Round Server.md`, *SERVICE → Dashboard*.
  - **Shown only when About or Settings is chosen with Option held, since 2026-09-24.** Syd: "This is a support option, anyway. I may not make the link public until you do some hidden action", then "I like having the link in both About and Settings if you are pressing the option key when invoking the menu". With Option, the About box shows the link and Settings gains a fourth panel, *Support*, holding the same link. Each choice of the menu item decides again, so choosing it without Option hides the link from a window already open. ⌥⌘, does not reach the Settings item, so for Settings it is the menu or nothing. `DashboardDisclosure`, in `AboutView.swift`.
  - **Not over HTTPS. Decided 2026-09-24.** The browser marks the page *Not Secure*, and that stays. Syd: "not worth it. we aren't doing this. ... it's ok for this to do the secure check when I am supporting a user." The listener is loopback only, so TLS would protect nothing on the wire, and a certificate the browser trusts needs a password prompt on every Mac. `Plans/PLAN.md`, *The dashboard is not served over HTTPS*.
- *Time between pictures* — how long each picture stays up, chosen in Settings: one pop-up for the screensaver, one for the wallpaper. **Done 2026-09-14.** Syd: "Please mark this feature as complete." The picture window's picker was built later the same day, as separate work. The tests pass. Syd, the same day, once it was running: "app is running and is looking great." And after using it: "I have changed the screensaver settings a couple of times, and created a new app window. things look great." **The log confirms the window's copy:** `panel: screensaver shuffle set to oneMinute` at 09:11:20, then a new window's `app: starting, each picture up for 60 seconds` at 09:11:29. **The screensaver was exercised once it was installed with `--install`:** see *Behaviour* in *Time between pictures* below.
  - Settings has three panels: Sources, with subpanels for Apple Photos, Google Photos (eventually), and files; Screensaver; and Wallpaper.
  - Screensaver and Wallpaper each hold a "Shuffle All" pop-up. Wallpaper held the *Also set wallpapers* checkbox above its pop-up until 2026-09-16; the wallpaper's pop-up now sets the wallpaper extension's interval.
  - The screensaver defaults to every ten seconds and the wallpaper to every hour.
  - A new picture window takes the screensaver's interval when it is created and keeps its own copy, even if the screensaver's interval changes later.
  - The picture window's picker was built after the rest, as separate work. See *The window's picker*.
- *A menu bar app* — the picture window becomes something the app can show rather than the app itself. **Not built.**
  - **Probably the shipping form, 2026-09-10:** "The full desktop app is useful, but we are probably not going to ship it." See TODO.md, *A menu-bar app for shipping*.
  - **Firmer, 2026-09-14:** "this app is a development playground for the settings, and to test. the real shipping app will need to be a menubar app that brings up the settings, and won't have its own window." So the picture window, and everything planned for it — *The window's picker*, *Navigation in the picture window* — is for development, not for shipping.
  - A status item, and an item that brings the window up.
  - **Deliberately unfinished.** What else belongs in that menu, whether the Dock icon goes with it, and what closing the last window means are all open.
- *Later, in the same places* — the Display tab for timer duration and fit; going backwards through history. *For the screensaver and the wallpaper, timer duration is now* Time between pictures*. The picture window's is designed there too, under* The window's picker*.*

# Design Decisions

- **The architecture is `PLAN.md`'s, not this document's.** The database is private to the service; a client asks over HTTP and never opens the store; preferences stay the durable source list, the discovery channel, and `pgr_ctl`'s business; a source is named by its `Source.uuid`. See *The database is private to the service*.
- **Settings, not the File menu.** Adding and removing act on one list, and only one of them has a picker shape.
- **A `Window` scene of the app's own, not SwiftUI's `Settings` scene. Changed 2026-08-26.** `Settings` gives the menu item and ⌘, for free and will not yield a resizable window at any price — `.windowResizability(.contentMinSize)` declared on it is ignored. `CommandGroup(replacing: .appSettings)` buys both back in two lines.
- **Apple Photos is a panel, not a row and not a section.** There is one Photos library and there always will be, so what Settings holds is one standing statement of which collections are in play. It also gives authorization somewhere permanent to live, which a picker that exists only while it is open cannot.
- **The lower list is everything that is *not* a Photos collection**, rather than folders and files by name, so a kind the panel has not been taught about appears somewhere it can be seen and removed instead of being configured and invisible.
- **The picker is a chooser, not an adder.** What is ticked when you press Done *is* the set of Photos sources — so it opens showing what is already true, and unticking removes a source. There is one Photos library and it does not get added to twice.
- **Apple has no collection picker, and this is not a gap we filled reluctantly.** `PHPickerResult` carries an asset identifier and an item provider; `PHPickerCapabilitiesCollectionNavigation` lets somebody browse *into* an album and still returns photographs. Checked against the macOS 27.0 SDK.
- **One window telling another is not a doorbell.** The agent rings `.sourcesChanged` for every edit and this app does not listen. What the picker announces is narrower: a change *this app* just made, which another of its own windows is displaying. Waiting a minute to redraw something we did ourselves reads as a panel that has broken.
- **The word is "photo", not "photograph."** It matches the product's own name. Prose in these documents is not bound by it.
- **One source per file, grouped in the UI later.** The deck already treats a pinned photograph and a folder of ten thousand alike; changing that to tidy a list would be a schema change. The grouping is *Sources by kind, in sections*, which superseded collapsing them into one row.
- **"Add contents of contained folders", not "Recursive."** Read by people who have never heard the word. Per folder, default off, not sticky.
- **One request, one write, one doorbell.** `POST` takes an array rather than one source, because adding two hundred one at a time would ask the agent to refresh two hundred times.
- **Configure is a `PATCH`, not a remove-and-re-add.** A source keeps its `uuid`, its cache directory, and its deal history when a checkbox changes; recreating it would throw all three away for a tick box. It is a sheet rather than an inline control because a Photos album will have several options and this is the shape that grows.
- **The panel does not need the endpoint for file and folder sources at all.** It is unsandboxed, so preferences and the filesystem give it everything about one except the photo count. The endpoint stays because other kinds will need it: a Photos or Google album is not a path, and only the agent can answer for it. See *What the panel could get without the agent*.
- **Where a source stands, the app just looks.** `SourceAvailability.of(path:)` is the library's own rule — in `PhotosGoRoundAgentAPI`, which the app links, rather than the kit, which it does not — run here on the path the app already has. **The endpoint deliberately does not check** — it reports what the last scan concluded — because an answer that came over HTTP is a round trip old before it is drawn, and making the agent `stat` every source on every read would buy a worse answer at a higher price.
- **The panel polls, because nothing rings a doorbell it can hear.** `pgr_ctl` removes a source, a drive is unplugged, a freshly added folder finishes scanning — none of those reach this process. Opening Settings re-reads, and after that it is **every minute** (`SourcesModel.pollInterval`); a failed read tries again in fifteen seconds, because noticing the agent is back should not take a full minute.
- **A control sizes its label, never itself.** A borderless button hit-tests its *content*, so putting the frame on the button reserves space that looks clickable and is not — the glyph is a few points across and every click beside it lands nowhere. `−` was dead for exactly this reason, with the model in a perfectly good state.
- **The panel says what it is doing, and the logging stays in.** `panel:` on every line, so the Xcode console filters to it in one word: what was pressed, what the selection is, what the flags gating the buttons were, what a read returned. Info is cheap; the hit-testing fault was found in a single click by a log line saying the button was enabled and no press had arrived.
- **A spinner, and everything disabled until the change lands.** Any action that goes to the agent locks the `+`, `−`, and Configure controls *and* the list, so nothing can be pressed twice and the selection cannot move under the buttons. Without it a working panel and a broken one look identical — which is what "I hit `−` and nothing happened" turned out to be.
- **The selection follows its source by locator.** A source can keep its place in the list and change identity, because anything that takes it out of the durable list and puts it back mints a new `uuid`. Dropping the selection then leaves a row that still looks chosen while every control reads *nothing selected*.
- **Advancing is gated from the draw, not the request.** A slow fetch is then harmless, and coalescing needs no separate mechanism. Decided for *Navigation in the picture window*, which is not built.
- **The photograph window acknowledges nothing.** New pictures simply appear; the panel is where a change is confirmed, because that is where it was made.

# Background

The app is a client: it reads `servicePort` from preferences, asks the service for a picture, and draws what it is handed. It links `PhotosGoRoundAgentAPI` and `PhotosGoRoundDisplay`, and not the kit. Its Settings panel adds and removes sources over HTTP. Before that panel existed, sources were configured only by `pgr_ctl`, or by `--add-folder` and `PGR_FOLDERS` at the agent's launch — and `pgr_ctl` is internal and never ships, so there was no user-facing way to add a photograph to the library at all.

One statement in `PLAN.md` says this should not exist, and it is the one argued with below: *The Mac app as instrument panel* has the Phase 3 app "manages no sources and exposes no settings, because `pgr_ctl` shipped one phase earlier and already does both." The other two it contradicts — *Identifiers*' rule that `pgr_ctl` owns preference writes, and *Preferences*' line that derived state lives in the database — are answered in `PLAN.md` itself, where the mechanism now lives.

# Detailed discussions

## The architecture this rests on lives in PLAN.md

Building this panel forced a system-wide decision, and it is recorded where every surface reads it rather than here: **`PLAN.md`, *The database is private to the service*.** In short — no client opens the database, clients ask the agent over HTTP for pictures *and* for facts, preferences remain the durable source list and the way `servicePort` is found, `pgr_ctl` is the rig rather than a client and keeps its direct access, and WAL stays for reasons that moved inside the agent.

That section also carries what it revised elsewhere in `PLAN.md`, and the debt it leaves in `pgr_ctl`'s remaining verbs. Everything below is what is specific to this app.

## Why this reverses "the app manages no sources"

The original argument was scope discipline and it was right at the time: `pgr_ctl` had shipped one phase earlier, it did sources properly, and a second implementation would have cost the phase its smallness. What it did not weigh is that `pgr_ctl` **never ships**. So "the app manages no sources because the tool does" quietly means "a user who is not Syd cannot add a photograph to their own library" — not a scope decision but a missing product.

The reversal stays narrow. The app gains sources and nothing else; enable, disable, refresh, cache clearing, and every tuning preference stay in `pgr_ctl` until something makes each a gap the same way.

## Why Settings rather than the File menu

The first sketch put `Add Files…` and `Add Folder…` in the File menu, and it was wrong for a reason worth keeping: **removing has no menu-item shape.** A picker shows the filesystem, not the library, so a File-menu remove would ask the user to navigate to a folder in order to say "not that one", and would silently do nothing if they chose one that was never a source. Add would live in one place and remove in a command-line tool the user does not have.

A panel dissolves that. The list is what you act on, removal is selecting a row, and adding is a button that happens to open a picker. It also produces the acknowledgement a menu item could not: **the new source appears in the list immediately**, because the app just wrote it and does not have to ask anyone.

macOS has a place for this: the Settings window, under the application menu and on ⌘,.

**It is not SwiftUI's `Settings` scene, as of 2026-08-26.** That scene gives the menu item and the shortcut for free, and it would not give a window the user can resize — `.windowResizability(.contentMinSize)` declared on it is ignored, and reaching the `NSWindow` to insert `.resizable` in its style mask did not help either. It is a `Window` scene now, with `CommandGroup(replacing: .appSettings)` restating the menu item and ⌘,. Two lines, and the window resizes.

## Two panels, because there is one Photos library

The first sketch had Photos as another row in the list, and the one after it had a picker opened from the `+` menu. Both are wrong in the same way: they treat a Photos source as *a source*, one of a growing list you add to.

There is one Photos library on this machine and there always will be. What Settings holds is therefore not a list to append to but **one standing statement of which collections are in play** — so it is a panel, permanently present, above the list of things that genuinely are a growing collection.

It holds three things: the chosen collections comma-separated, capped at three lines so that checking forty of them cannot push the folder list off the bottom; the total number of photos across them, right-aligned above the button; and `Select Collections…`, which opens the picker.

**The count is a plain sum and that is now correct.** One asset in three collections is one row belonging to whichever collection reached it first, so adding the per-source counts cannot double-count — see `PLAN.md`, *One photograph, one row*. Before that landed it would have, and badly, since overlapping collections are the normal case rather than the exception. While any chosen collection is unscanned the line reads "so far", for the same reason a fresh row says "scanning…" instead of "0 photos": a number that silently omits a collection nobody has walked yet is a delay dressed as an answer.

**What the shape buys that a picker alone could not** is somewhere for authorization to live. A dialog that exists only while it is open has nowhere to say *this app has not been given access to your photo library*, and nowhere to put the button that asks. That state is not built yet and now has a home waiting for it.

**What it costs** is that the panel is present even for someone who never uses Photos, saying "No collections selected." That is the right trade: it is one line, and it is also the only place the feature announces that it exists.

## The picker, and the three shapes it went through

The first sketch was a popup menu of album names, one at a time. The second was a modal picker opened from `+`. The third is what shipped, and the two before it were wrong in the same way: they treated a Photos collection as *a source*, one of a growing list you add to.

It is not. There is one Photos library and there always will be, which is why the panel holds a standing statement of what is in play rather than a list you append to, and why the picker is a chooser rather than an adder.

**It is an outline because Photos has real folders.** Four flat sections lost them, and with them the only thing that tells two same-named albums apart: a measured library of 439 collections had 31 titles used more than once. Twenty-two of those spanned sections and were already distinguishable by their heading; the remaining nine were separated by their counts, which was luck — counts arrive late and two albums can be the same size. The tree removes the luck.

**Folders get three-state checkboxes and are never sources.** A folder holds albums, not photographs. Its checkbox summarises what is beneath it and is derived on every draw, so there is no folder state anywhere that could drift out of step with the albums. It is a real `NSButton` with `allowsMixedState` rather than an approximation drawn from SF Symbols, because a control that looks *nearly* like the system's is worse than the system's.

**A search field was built and removed.** Three hundred and fifty-three albums is not browsable as one list, and a search box is the obvious answer — but collapsing the three sections you are not looking in does the same job with a control that is already there for its own reasons.

**Favorites is pinned above the headings.** Technically an album; not one in any other sense. Library and Recents have the same argument and were deliberately left where they are, because ticking Library is 95,904 photographs in a single click.

## The beat between asking and knowing

`POST /v1/sources` does not wait for the scan. It resolves the paths, writes them, and answers — because a folder of eight thousand photographs takes seconds to walk, and a request that blocked on it would look like a hang for the one case that matters most.

So a freshly added folder appears at once with its name, its icon, and no count, and the number arrives on a later `GET`. That is honest rather than a gap: the delay *is* the agent doing the work, and a count that appeared instantly would be a lie.

What the status code does buy, which publication never could, is the immediate half of the answer. A path that stopped resolving between the dialog and the request comes back as a refusal naming it, rather than as a source that quietly never produces anything.

What stays silent is narrower but not nothing: an empty folder and a folder still being scanned look alike until the number lands, and a denied TCC grant shows as unavailable only once the agent has tried. With no agent, nothing can be added at all — and nothing could be shown either, so the panel says the same thing the window does.

## The longer beat: a source is added long before it is *seen*

Distinct from the one above, and worth separating because a user hits it as one experience. The count arriving late is seconds. **A photograph from that source actually appearing in the window can be many minutes**, and on 2026-08-24 it was measured at hours for a network folder — with nothing anywhere saying why.

Three delays compose, and only the first is the scan:

1. **The scan.** Seconds. The panel shows this honestly as no count yet.
2. **Having bytes.** For a source on a network volume or in Photos this now comes *before* reaching the queue, and it is the long step. The cache draws remote photographs at random and fetches them at its own pace — twice the deck's size at launch, then one per picture shown — so a new network source warms in proportion to how much of the library it is, and a fetch that does not answer within its bound (a minute for a file, fifteen for a photo library) is abandoned and its source is rested rather than holding a slot. A photograph on the boot volume skips this step entirely: it is read where it lies.
3. **Reaching the queue.** Once a photograph has bytes it joins the deck's pool, and cards are dealt from one shuffled order over that pool. A card is only dealt when there is room for one, and the agent fills the queue whether or not anybody is watching, so a source added to an idle library reaches the queue rather than waiting for somebody to open the window.

Step 2 is the one that surprises, because it is invisible: the source is present, available, correctly counted, and shows nothing. **A large network source warms over hours, not minutes.**

What it does *not* do, measured 2026-08-26, is settle at a permanently reduced share. The cache rotates, so a photograph enters the deck's pool as a card that has never been dealt — and a never-dealt card is eligible where the rest are waiting out the repeat window. Across two ratios the remote half's share of the screen matched its share of the library, from a resident set as small as three photographs in ninety-three. What bounds it is how fast the fetches land, not how much of the cache it occupies.

**Nothing in the panel says any of this**, and something probably should. The honest number is not a percentage of the library cached — that would read as a progress bar for something that never completes, since the cache is a bounded window and not a copy. Whatever it becomes, the fact to convey is "reachable and warming" as a state distinct from "reachable", so a folder added an hour ago that has shown nothing does not look broken. Unresolved; recorded so the next person to notice it does not have to re-derive it from a log.

**Step 3 shrank a great deal on 2026-08-24, and the reason is worth knowing here rather than only in `PLAN.md`.** Three agent-side changes — a fetched photograph returns to the queue instead of waiting to be dealt again, the deck advances at the rate pictures are shown rather than at the rate cards are consumed, and cards are placed at random positions instead of at the back. Measured end to end on a real network folder, from a card being dealt to its photograph being displayed: **8m 38s** before, **4m 46s** after. Of that original figure, one second was the network and the rest was queue traversal.

So the delay a user experiences is set almost entirely by `queueSize`, which is a preference and not a property of their storage. That matters for what the panel could eventually say: "warming" is a state with a knowable duration, not an indefinite one.

## TCC, the pickers, and whose grant is whose

Two processes are involved and only one is looking at a window, which is what makes this confusing later.

The app is unsandboxed, so `NSOpenPanel` returns paths it could have read anyway, and what it does with them is write strings into preferences. **No access is transferred to the agent**, and none needs to be: the agent is unsandboxed too and reads the paths itself.

What the agent may still need is TCC consent — Files-and-Folders for `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, `~/Downloads`, iCloud Drive, removable and network volumes. Consent is keyed to a code-signing identity, and the agent is a separate bundle with its own, so the prompt names the agent rather than the app. The picker cannot avoid that and should not try: *TCC: unsandboxed does not mean unrestricted* decided that only the server touches files, which is what keeps every privacy grant on one bundle and one entry in each Settings list.

What the picker buys is timing. A background process with no window prompting for Documents access is baffling; the same prompt two seconds after the user chose a folder in a dialog is legible. The plan asked for exactly this and had nothing to hang it on until there was a window.

**This is also why the panel has no refresh button.** Adding a folder the user just chose is fine. Re-enumerating arbitrary existing sources from the app would make the app touch files in its own right, and that is the line that keeps the grant on one bundle.

## What the panel can show, and the correction that got us here

An earlier draft of this document claimed the panel had to show bare paths because that was all the app could see without the database. **That was wrong twice over.**

The app is unsandboxed, so the filesystem is directly available: leaf names, `NSWorkspace.shared.icon(forFile:)`, and QuickLook thumbnails, none of which involve the database, the cache, or the service. And `GET /v1/sources` supplies the rest — real counts and availability, from the one process that knows them.

So the list shows an icon, a name, a count, and a state, with the path secondary — and an icon-grid modality is a later refinement rather than a different architecture. The one degradation to expect: a source added by `pgr_ctl` may sit somewhere the *app* has never been granted, and the graceful answer is a generic icon rather than a prompt.

The visual language stays plain regardless, and that is a decision about where effort goes. The screensaver is the surface where presentation **is** the product; whatever it settles — how a photograph is presented small, what a missing one looks like, how motion is used — is what this panel should borrow from rather than inventing a second answer now that would be the worse of the two.

## One source per file, and what it costs

`SourceKind.file` is first-class, and the plan is explicit that pinning one photograph and adding a folder of ten thousand are the same operation to the deck. A selection of two hundred photographs therefore produces two hundred specs, two hundred rows, and two hundred entries in the preferences array.

The cost is presentational: `pgr_ctl sources list` becomes a wall of one-photo sources and the panel's list does too. The alternative — a kind holding a set of files — was rejected because it is a schema change, a provider change, and a spelling `pgr_ctl --file` could not round-trip, all to fix how a list prints. So the model stays and the panel collapses them later: one row reading "12 photographs" that expands, and one act that removes the set. **Superseded by *Sources by kind, in sections*:** a Files section with multiple selection does the same job without the batch identifier described next.

One thing to remember when building that: these sources have **no group identity in the data.** They are individually chosen photographs that happen to have been picked in one dialog. Grouping by anything but kind would mean inventing a batch identifier — a schema change deferred rather than avoided.

## "Add contents of contained folders"

The preference is `recursive`, the flag is `--recursive`, and the checkbox says neither, because it is read by somebody who would not guess that means "and everything inside it."

- **Per folder, not per run.** The plan fixed this once already, after recursion applied to a whole command and a flat directory and a nested tree could not be added together. One folder per dialog keeps the checkbox honest.
- **Default off.** The surprising direction is the expensive one — walking a home directory by accident costs minutes and thousands of photographs nobody meant to add.
- **Not sticky.** Remembering the last answer applies a previous decision to a different folder unattended, and the expensive direction is the one that would be inherited.

**Unticking it later is a removal**, and the sheet says so before you do it. The photographs inside contained folders leave the pool and take their cached copies and their deal history with them — the same rule as any other departure, since a photograph nested inside a source that no longer reaches that far is not in that source, however healthily it sits on disk. Ticking it again finds them at the next scan, as new photographs with no history.

## Finding a dead button

Worth writing down because every plausible explanation was wrong, and the way through was not reasoning.

`−` did nothing. The candidates were all about state — the selection binding not updating, the row's identity changing underneath it, a change still in flight blocking the next one — and each had been a real bug at some point that evening, which made all of them credible. Two were fixed on the strength of it. Neither was this.

One line logging the press, and one logging the selection with the flags that gate the button, settled it in a single click: `can remove true, working false`, and no press. The button was enabled and the click never reached it. That leaves hit-testing, and nothing else.

**The general lesson is the cheap one.** A control that does nothing looks identical whether it is disabled, unbound, or unhittable, and no amount of reading the model tells them apart. A line that says *the press happened* separates the third from the first two before any theory is needed.

## The app has tests of its own

Added with the Settings panel, because the model is where the panel's behaviour actually lives: what a refusal leaves on screen, whether Configure is offered for what is selected, what happens to the selection when the row under it changes identity, and what the panel does while a change is in flight.

**What it cannot cover is the window.** The first bug this panel shipped with — a double-click gesture on a row swallowing the click that sets the selection, so every control acted on nothing — lived entirely in the view, and thirty passing tests said nothing about it. The target earns its keep on the model and the client; the window still needs somebody looking at it.

**Poll intervals are injected** for the same reason a socket test has a deadline: a test that waits three real minutes to prove a timer stopped is a test nobody runs. That one is not hypothetical — it was written with the production interval and took three minutes.

## What the panel could get without the agent

**Captured, not acted on. The app does not write the agent's preferences, and is not to start.** Everything it changes in the library still goes over HTTP; the one agent preference it reads is `servicePort`, which is how it finds the agent at all. Its own settings are another matter, and live in domains the agent does not read: the wallpaper's *Shuffle All* interval in the wallpaper's (`Wallpaper Plan.md`), and `advanceIntervalSeconds` in the app's (*Advancing costs a card*).

**That one preference is a single point of confusion, and it bit on 2026-08-24.** The port is published by whichever agent started most recently, and the app follows it without asking whose it is. A second agent — started for a scratch run with `--container` and `--cache-root`, which isolate storage but *not* the preference domain — published over the running one, and the app began serving from an empty scratch library: real photographs, but a deck starting at ordinal 1 and every request a cold miss. When that scratch agent exited, the published port pointed at nothing and the window said "No agent" while a perfectly healthy agent was listening on the port it used to own. Neither state is distinguishable from a real fault by looking at the app. This is written down because it matters when the next source kind arrives, and because it is the sort of thing that gets rediscovered expensively.

**Settled: a test agent does not publish `servicePort` at all.** It serves normally and is reached by a port handed to `curl` and `pgr_ctl` by hand; nothing announces it, so nothing follows it. Starting a second agent to poke at becomes a safe thing to do rather than something that quietly redirects the window mid-session.

**The decision is the agent's to keep, and that is why this shape won.** The alternative considered was a reserved port — or range — that this app refuses on sight, and it is the worse answer twice over: it puts a blocklist in the client, which is a rule that can be got wrong by the side with the least information, and it still leaves a scratch agent publishing over the real one for every port outside the range. Not publishing removes the confusion at its source instead of teaching one reader to ignore it. **No app change at all**, which is the tell — the app already does the right thing with a port nobody overwrote.

What it costs is discovery: an unpublished agent cannot be found by anything that does not already know its port, so the flag should say what it bound plainly enough to copy out of a terminal. That is the whole of the trade, and it is the right way round — a test agent is started by someone who is watching.

**For a file or folder source, the panel needs the agent for one fact.** This app is unsandboxed and links `PhotosGoRoundAgentAPI`, which carries preferences and the availability rule, so it can read the durable list itself and look at the filesystem:

| | preferences and the filesystem | only the agent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| kind, locator, recursive, enabled | yes | |
| name, icon, whether it can be reached | yes | |
| **photo count** | | yes |
| `uuid` | | yes |

The `uuid` costs nothing — preferences key on the locator, and so would the panel. **The photo count is the only real loss**, and it is the one number in that row that cannot be computed from a path: it lives in the pool, which is the database, which is the service's.

**The endpoint is not going away**, because the argument only holds for kinds that are paths. A Photos album is a `PHAssetCollection` identifier and a Google album is an id on somebody's server; neither can be looked at from here, and the agent is the only process that can say whether they are reachable or how many photographs they hold.

**What would still be true if the panel wrote preferences directly.** `PLAN.md`'s *The database is private to the service* rejected preferences-as-transport for five reasons, and three of them weaken for this app specifically: it resolves paths itself, so it knows immediately whether one is real; and it reads back its own writes, so it never watches its own change arrive late. **Two writers on one array does not weaken at all** — `pgr_ctl` writes the same key, `UserDefaults` has no compare-and-swap, and a lost update is a source that silently did not get added.

## Removing, and what it does not touch

`remove` drops the source from preferences; its photographs and their queue entries go by cascade. **Its cached bytes go with them, at that moment** — the originals we copied. There are no renderings to remove since 2026-09-06: every sized request renders fresh and keeps nothing. That is a correction: this document used to say they were left for a running agent to reclaim on its next maintenance pass, and no such pass existed. The only reclaim was the byte index being rebuilt at the *next launch*, so removing a large source freed nothing until the agent was restarted. See `PLAN.md`, *Rows and bytes leave together*.

`pgr_ctl cache clear --source` remains the way to free one source's space *without* removing it, which the panel does not offer and should not: it is a storage operation with a price worth stating, and stating prices is what `pgr_ctl` is for.

Removal is not deletion. Nothing on disk is touched — only the library's knowledge of it. Disabling, for "not right now", stays in `pgr_ctl`; the panel offers the destructive-sounding verb because it is the one with a user-facing need.

## Advancing costs a card

**None of this is built.** `Shuffle` has no manual advance and `advanceIntervalSeconds` does not exist; this is the design for *Navigation in the picture window*.

Serving pops the queue and the pop is irreversible — no reservation, nothing to reclaim. So there is one rule, and it belongs in `Shuffle` where every trigger inherits it:

> **A request may be issued no sooner than `advanceIntervalSeconds` after the current picture was drawn.**

The clock starts at the **draw**, not at the previous request, and that is what makes a slow fetch harmless: however long the bytes take, the next request still waits half a second after the picture they produced went up. A held key changes the picture every half second plus whatever the fetch costs.

Coalescing needs no separate mechanism. The gate cannot open while a fetch is outstanding, because nothing has been drawn yet — so two requests can never be in flight and no popped photograph is ever discarded. A keypress arriving early is dropped rather than queued.

`advanceIntervalSeconds` would default to 0.5 and be parsed with a default and a clamp like every other key.

**Changed 2026-09-14: it is a window setting and is not stored.** Syd: "yes, it's a window setting and not stored." That overrides the paragraph below about a preference domain of the app's own. **It stays a named setting**, not a bare constant, as Claude had proposed: "you can keep advanceintervalseconds."

**It lives in a preference domain of the app's own, not the agent's.** The agent never reads it, and the agent's domain is a black box that clients neither read nor write — Syd, 2026-09-09, TODO.md's *Settings endpoints, and preferences as a black box*. An earlier version of this section put it in the agent's domain, so that `pgr_ctl set` could tune it and it would turn up in a `pgr_ctl get` listing as the one key the agent ignores; that is what changed. `UserDefaults.standard` is not the answer either, because the app's bundle identifier, `com.sydpolk.photosgoround`, *is* the production agent's domain. So it follows the wallpaper's pattern — one domain per deployment, belonging to the app. The name is not decided.

## Building forwards so that backwards fits

Going backwards is a later feature, but it decides the shape of forwards: once there is history, advancing must walk it before asking the service for anything new. Retrofitting that means rewriting the advance path rather than adding to it.

So the path is to be built around a cursor that only ever moves forward — it is not built yet — and "back" later becomes a ring capacity, a key binding, and a second chevron. The storage question that comes with it is worth recording early: a ring of decoded 4K `CGImage`s is tens of megabytes apiece, while the served bytes are a few hundred kilobytes — so history should hold `ServedPicture` and decode on demand.

Mechanically, the dwell becomes interruptible by holding the sleep in its own task that the loop awaits; cancelling *that* ends the wait while the loop survives. Any advance restarts the full dwell, so a deliberate "next" gives a whole interval before the automatic one.

## Chevrons on the photograph

**Not built**, with the rest of *Navigation in the picture window*. Hovering the right edge reveals a chevron that fades on exit. The left one is **not drawn at all** until history exists — a control that can never become enabled is worse than no control.

They sit over the photograph, which is a deliberate exception to *Showing unavailability*'s "the photo is never annotated." That rule forbids badges and warnings defacing an image to report a problem elsewhere; it does not forbid a transient control that appears under the pointer and vanishes.

Keys are space, →, ↓, and page down, on the focused window. Each window owns its own `Shuffle`, so only the key window advances — the multi-window behaviour falls out of the existing design rather than needing arbitration.

## What happens if the app is ever sandboxed

*The sandbox contingency* names what would force it and what it would cost, and this adds one item.

Sandboxed, `NSOpenPanel` becomes a powerbox transaction: access arrives as a security-scoped bookmark rather than a path. Writing the path into preferences would hand the agent a string it has no right to use — except the agent is a separate, unsandboxed process, so it would work anyway. The fragility is that the app's ability to add a source would stop being a property of the app and become a property of the agent staying unsandboxed.

If both were sandboxed, the source list would carry bookmark data rather than paths — the change `SourceSpec` and `FileAccess` were built to absorb, one nullable column with the provider code identical either way. Worth knowing this feature is the first thing that would break, and that the insurance already exists.

## Time between pictures

**Done 2026-09-14**, including *The window's picker*. *Options in System Settings, later* is not built. Decided with Syd the same day.

### The Settings window

- **Three panels:** "One for the sources; one for screensaver-specific settings; one for wallpaper-specific settings."
- **Sources:** "One sources panel, with subpanels for apple photos, google photos (eventually), and one for files."
- **Screensaver:** the "Shuffle All" row.
- **Wallpaper:** the "Shuffle All" row, which sets the wallpaper extension's interval. It had the *Also set wallpapers* checkbox above it, with the row disabled while the checkbox was unticked, until the app's own loop went on 2026-09-16.

### The control

- **A pop-up menu, like System Settings' screen saver pane.** The row matches that pane: "Shuffle All" on the left, and the current choice with an up-and-down chevron button on the right. There is no second line under the title.
- **The choices:** "Every 10 Seconds", "Every 30 Seconds", "Every Minute", "Every 5 Minutes", "Every 10 Minutes", "Every 30 Minutes", "Every Hour", "Every 2 Hours", "Every 8 Hours", "Every 12 Hours", and "Every Day". No "Continuously".
- **Defaults:** "Every 10 Seconds" for the screensaver, and "Every Hour" for the wallpaper. The wallpaper's replaces the thirty minutes set on 2026-09-13.
- **A choice applies as soon as it is made.** There is no spinner, because nothing goes to the agent.

### Preferences

- **The wallpaper, the screensaver, the app window, and the agent each have their own preferences.** The one thing every client reads from the agent's domain is `servicePort`, and `ServicePort.read` already handles it.
- **The screensaver's domain** is `com.sydpolk.photosgoround.screensaver` (`….debug.screensaver`, `….claude.screensaver`), beside the wallpaper's `….wallpaper` — one per build since 2026-09-24, when the `.dev` and `.prod` pair went.
- **The value is stored as an enum tag in English camelCase**, under the key `interval`: `tenSeconds`, `thirtySeconds`, `oneMinute`, `fiveMinutes`, `tenMinutes`, `thirtyMinutes`, `oneHour`, `twoHours`, `eightHours`, `twelveHours`, `oneDay`. A tag becomes seconds when it is read and turns back into a tag when it is written, so the wallpaper loop and `Shuffle` keep working in seconds. A missing or unknown tag gives the default, and an unknown one is logged.
- **`intervalSeconds` is no longer read.** Syd deleted it from the development wallpaper domain, the only place it was set, on 2026-09-14.
- **The app window's preferences are not stored.** In this phase, before the window has a picker, "the app window will read the current screensaver internal when it is created, and it will stay there with its own copy of the setting even if the screensaver interval is changed."

### Behaviour

- **Wallpaper:** a changed interval acts only through the due rule. A display changes once its stored time plus the new interval has passed. Choosing in the pop-up asks which displays are due straight away; a `defaults write` is noticed within the loop's thirty-second recheck. Shortening can change a picture at once, and lengthening keeps the current one up longer.
- **Screensaver:** inside `legacyScreenSaver`'s sandbox, `UserDefaults(suiteName:)` comes back empty, so the saver reads the plist as a file, the way `ServicePort` does.
  - **The saver reads its interval before every picture.** `Shuffle` asks a closure instead of holding a fixed value. This was built that way, not measured.
  - **A change is never made while the saver is on screen.** Syd, 2026-09-14: "impossible to change the settings from the app while screensaver is running." What the per-picture read covers is a change made between sessions: `legacyScreenSaver` outlives a session and keeps each display's `Shuffle`, so the next session starts with the new value instead of the one the loop was made with.
  - **The file route works, measured 2026-09-14.** The first run of the new saver logged `saver: shuffle interval tenSeconds via file` at 09:18:04, then `screensaver: starting, each picture up for 10 seconds`. The app had written the tag at 09:12:11, and the plist's modification time was 09:12.
  - **A change made just before a session arrives one picture late, measured 2026-09-14.** Syd: "I just set screensaver to 30 seconds, and when I reinvoked it, it did not pick it up."
    - 09:18:38.442: `panel: screensaver shuffle set to thirtySeconds`.
    - 09:18:41.597: the session starts with `each picture up for 10 seconds`, and no `shuffle interval` line, so the file still said `tenSeconds`.
    - 09:18:48: the plist's modification time, ten seconds after the write. `cfprefsd` held it that long.
    - 09:18:52.407: `saver: shuffle interval thirtySeconds via file`. Every picture after that, and the next session at 09:19:24, used thirty seconds.

    The per-picture read did its job. What failed is that the file lags the app's write by about ten seconds.

    **Left as it is.** Syd: "seems to be a slight propogation delay. it's not a huge deal."

    **Whether a flush would remove the delay is unmeasured.** A probe the same day wrote to path-named domains in a scratch directory. The file carried the new value immediately, with no flush, with `synchronize()`, and with `CFPreferencesAppSynchronize` alike, so the probe could not reproduce the lag. Only a dotted domain under `~/Library/Preferences`, the real case, has shown it.

### The window's picker

**Done 2026-09-14, after the rest of the phase.** Syd, having used it: "this works well. pretty much." After the corrections recorded below: "looks good." **Choices Claude made while building**, none of which he changed:

- **The gear:** white at 35% opacity at rest, with a 12-point margin from the corner that scales with it. The margin was 16 while the gear was 48 points.
- **The right-click menu:** on a transparent SwiftUI layer over the picture, not on the picture itself. The picture and the empty state are AppKit views, and a right-click on one is not certain to reach a SwiftUI menu.
- **The sheet:** it has a Done button, because a standard sheet has no other way to close.
- **Tabs:** removed with `NSWindow.allowsAutomaticWindowTabbing = false`, set before the first window.

- **Three ways to reach it:**
  - a settings gear in the upper trailing corner, "transparent until the mouse moves over it (but visible)". Syd, 2026-09-14, on what that means:
    - "the gear is dimmed and transparent, but visibile (against the black background anyway; the picture may cause it to be not very visible, and that's ok)."
    - "When the user hovers over it, the gear itself becomes opague, but the negative space is still transparent."
    - "It about the same size as 48-point text is high, and should scale with text size accesibility settings." **Changed once it was built:** "The gear is too big; make it based on 24-point text."
    - "and should be in the upper trailing corner with some margin." The margin is Claude's to pick when building, and Syd will judge it by eye.
    - Clicking it "opens the sheet directly."
    - **Still unchecked when the feature was marked done:** which macOS text-size setting a SwiftUI view can follow. The gear uses `@ScaledMetric(relativeTo: .title)`, and whether the Mac's setting reaches it has not been tried.
  - a context menu anywhere in the window, the gear included — **changed 2026-09-14**, Syd: "Right click anywhere in the window will invoke context menu, even the gear," correcting the gear's first exclusion — with "Photos-Go-Round Settings…" (opens Settings, or brings it to the front) and "Window Settings…". Settled 2026-09-14: the app's name as it is spelled everywhere else, where he had written "PhotosGoRound". The ellipses went in, came out ("get rid of the elipsis in both menu items"), and went back once he had used it: "Put the elipsis back for both items in the context menu." The View menu's item has none;
  - the View menu, with "Window Settings" and Enter Full Screen. Syd, 2026-09-14: "keep Enter Full Screen. we are just removing tab support in the window, and replacing it with this window settings item." So the tab bar items go, because the window no longer supports tabs. **Wrong in the first build, and fixed the same day.** Syd: "The view menu doesn't work quite right; there is no divider and Enter Full Screen item." The cause is unmeasured: turning tabbing off, or SwiftUI rebuilding the View menu around its item, are both candidates. The app logs the View menu's items at launch and whenever the menu bar opens, prefixed `menu:`.
    - **The next run had it**, and the log showed when it arrives. At launch, 09:51:58, the View menu held only `Window Settings`. When the menu bar was opened, 09:52:05, it held `Window Settings [menuAction:], Enter Full Screen [toggleFullScreen:]`. So AppKit adds the item after launch, and tabbing being off does not stop it. Why the earlier run showed none is unexplained.
    - **A separator between the two**, after Syd saw it: "that's better, but it needs a separator." A `Divider()` after Window Settings.
- **Window Settings slides a sheet down from the top of the window** with the "Shuffle All" pop-up in it. The pop-up is live immediately.
  - **A standard Mac sheet.** Syd, 2026-09-14: "let's do a standard mac sheet; with a Done button if we have to."
  - **This replaces the sheet he first described**, which had no Done button, a grab handle that closed it when dragged up ("nothing else"), and a click anywhere else in the app to dismiss it. A standard sheet has neither a grab handle nor dismissal on an outside click. He chose the standard sheet over drawing one.
  - **A Done button if closing needs one**, decided while building.
- **A change counts from when the picture on screen appeared.** Syd, 2026-09-14: "change right away, counted from when the picture appeared." If a picture has been up forty seconds and the choice drops to thirty, it changes at once. A longer choice keeps it up until the new interval has passed since it appeared. The loop's wait therefore has to be interruptible, not a single sleep for the old interval.
- **The window's interval starts at the screensaver's** and is never stored.
- **Every question about it was answered on 2026-09-14.**

### Options in System Settings, later

"I want this now-popup menu to be available in the Options button we will eventually add to the system settings for both." Not in this phase. When it is built, two things apply:

- **The screensaver:** its Options sheet runs in the sandbox, which cannot write the screensaver's domain.
- **The wallpaper:** whether System Settings offers it an Options button at all is unchecked.

### Tests

- Each tag converts to its seconds and back. A missing or unknown tag gives the default.
- The wallpaper defaults to an hour. The existing thirty-minute test is changed first, and fails.
- The saver reads its interval from the plist file. Cover a missing domain, an unreadable one, and nonsense, mirroring `ServicePort`'s tests.
- A new window takes the screensaver's interval, and a window already open keeps its own copy when the screensaver's interval changes.
- For the window work:
  - a change writes nothing;
  - a running `Shuffle` given a shorter dwell than the picture has been up changes it at once;
  - a running `Shuffle` given a longer dwell waits until that dwell has passed since the picture appeared.

  The gear, the menus, and the sheet are checked by looking at them.

### Documents this will contradict

None of these has been edited.

- **`Wallpaper Plan.md`:**
  - the thirty-minute default;
  - `intervalSeconds` in seconds;
  - the checkbox under two panels;
  - *The set of interval choices*, which this answers.
- **`Screensaver Plan.md`:** *Whether the dwell becomes a preference*.
- **`PLAN.md`:**
  - *Everything user-settable is a user default*, held back to Beyond 0.1;
  - *Showing unavailability*, which the gear sits against.
- **This document:**
  - *Sources in Settings* and *Two panels, because there is one Photos library*, which are now subpanels of one Sources panel;
  - *Sources by kind, in sections*, on where Google Photos goes;
  - *Chevrons on the photograph*, whose exception was argued for a control that vanishes.
- **In code:** `PhotosGoRoundApp`'s "chrome overlapping the image is the one thing this window must not do" was rewritten when the gear was built. `Shuffle.defaultDwell` and `SourcesSettingsView`'s "Not in a panel of its own" went in the first build.

## Captured, not designed

Raised and deliberately not worked out.

- Copy the current image to the clipboard.
- Print the current image.
- Save the current image to a file.
- Drop an image from the queue from the app.
- A thumbnail for each file-backed source in the settings list, in place of the generic file icon.
- The grow / shrink / stretch / aspect-ratio family, which needs the service's `fit` parameter — already parked in `PLAN.md`'s Phase 3.
- **Deleting the file itself gets its own plan.** Not an app feature: it crosses the app, the service, the pool, the deck's history, the cache, and the source, and it is the only irreversible thing the product would do. Everything `PLAN.md` says about deletion today is *reactive* — noticing a photograph somebody else removed and ceasing to show it. Removing one on purpose runs the other way and nothing covers it.

Two facts that already exist and would otherwise be rediscovered. **Saving** wants a filename and the response carries none — that is `X-PGR-Name`, item 8 on the known-shortcomings list, unbuilt; printing and the clipboard need only the bytes. And *Never showing a photo the user deleted* is where the delete-from-source design would have to start.

## Documents this contradicts

Not edited here; recorded so the contradictions are deliberate.

- **`Documentation/Photos-Go-Round Server.md`** — updated. SERVICE still opens on the one request that matters and now carries a *Sources* subsection for the five that manage the library, and DESCRIPTION acknowledges that a client commands the source list over HTTP while configuring never requires the agent. Its PREFERENCES table does **not** gain `advanceIntervalSeconds`: that key is the app's, in the app's own domain, and the agent never reads it. *Corrected 2026-09-10; this line used to say the table would gain it once the key existed.*
- **`Documentation/pgr_ctl.md`** — unaffected. `pgr_ctl` keeps preferences and the database and gains no web verbs, so every word of it stays true.
- **`PLAN.md`** — already reconciled: *The Mac app as instrument panel* now records the reversal, and *The database is private to the service* carries the rest.
