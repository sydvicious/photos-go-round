# Photos-Go-Round

Take a giant blob of photos and do something nice with it.

A background agent maintains a shuffled queue of photographs drawn from folders
on disk — eventually Apple Photos and Google Photos — keeps their bytes
available, and serves them to whatever wants to display one: desktop wallpaper,
screensaver, widgets, and apps across Apple's platforms. The library problem
(what to show, in what order, cached where) is split from the display problem
(how to show it), so one deck feeds every surface.

## Building and installing from Xcode

Open `Photos-Go-Round.xcodeproj`. Everything below is the Debug configuration; Release is Archive, moved to `/Applications` by hand.

**The app installs the rest.** Every build carries the agent, the wallpaper extension and the screensaver in its bundle. Each launch installs its agent when it is missing, not running or of a lesser version, and leaves it alone otherwise; a Release launch does the same for the wallpaper and the screensaver. The Help menu installs or uninstalls any of the three, in any build. Nothing is copied out of the app.

**⌘B builds, ⌘R installs**, since 2026-09-19. Building an install scheme changes nothing.

| To | Scheme | Key |
|---|---|---|
| Run the app, which installs its agent when it needs to | **Photos-Go-Round** | ⌘R |
| Install the wallpaper or the screensaver from it | Help › Install Wallpaper, Install Screensaver | |
| Install the agent, and restart it | **Install Agent** | ⌘R |
| Install the wallpaper extension | **Install Wallpaper Extension** | ⌘R |
| Install the screensaver | **Install Screen Saver** | ⌘R |
| Run the agent under the debugger | **Photos-Go-Round Server** | ⌘R |
| Run every test | **Package Tests** | ⌘U |

`Package Tests` covers the package's five test targets. From a terminal, note that it takes no `-project`, because a scheme whose targets are the package's is a package scheme:

```
xcodebuild test -scheme "Package Tests" -destination "platform=macOS,arch=arm64"
```

The app's own bundle, `Photos-Go-RoundTests`, is not in it: it wants a running agent. Run it through the **Photos-Go-Round** scheme.

`pgr_ctl` has no shared scheme. Build its target and put the product on your `PATH` — a copy or a symlink into `~/bin`. Not `swift run pgr_ctl`: that writes a `.build` directory into the checkout, and nothing generated belongs there.

The `Install …` schemes are the development route. Install the agent first; the wallpaper and the screensaver get their pictures from it. Each builds its product and `pgr_install`, and ⌘R runs it — so ⌘R is the whole step, and ⌘R again reinstalls. Launching the app afterwards points the agent at the app's own copy.

Each build configuration installs under its own names, so Debug, Release and an agent's `Claude` build can sit on one Mac at once without displacing each other. `Documentation/Installing.md` has the table.

Then choose them in System Settings:

- **Wallpaper** › *Photos-Go-Round* › **Photos-Go-Round Wallpaper (Debug)**
- **Screen Saver** › *Other* › **Photos-Go-Round Screensaver (Debug)**

To take a build's three off the Mac, leaving the library, cache and preferences alone — `--variant release`, `debug` or `claude`, or `--all`:

```bash
./Scripts/uninstall.sh --variant debug
```

`./Scripts/install.sh` puts them back from a terminal, and `./Scripts/scrub-data.sh` deletes a build's library, cache and preferences; both take the same `--variant` or `--all`.

[`Documentation/Installing.md`](Documentation/Installing.md) has what each install does and how to check it worked.

## Running the agent

```
./Scripts/run-server.sh --add-folder ~/Pictures/Wallpaper
```

The wrapper builds first, so a stale binary is never run — the `Photos-Go-Round
Server` target, so the agent it runs carries its configuration's port and label
exactly as an installed one does. `--release` and `--claude` pick another. A bare invocation runs
the agent — it has exactly one job and takes no subcommand. Name each folder
once; it is written through to preferences, and every later run needs no
arguments at all:

```
./Scripts/run-server.sh --port 9000
```

`--add-folder` does not walk subdirectories unless `--recursive` is given between
it and the path, which applies to that folder alone. **Each build has exactly one
library**, `~/Library/Application Support/<identifier>` and the matching cache and
preference domain, and nothing chooses another. `<identifier>` carries the build
configuration — `com.sydpolk.photosgoround`, `….debug`, `….claude` — so a
release, a Debug and an agent's build never share a library.

The agent serves pictures on a fixed port — one per build configuration — and
publishes it where every process on the machine can read it; `pgr_ctl status`
prints the address. `--port` pins a different number, which is what you want for
a URL you are going to type.

## Inspecting and configuring it

`pgr_ctl` is the rig: sources, preferences, the pool, the queue, the cache, and
the deck's statistical checks. It never needs the agent running.

Build its scheme and put the product on your `PATH` — a copy or a symlink into
`~/bin`. Then, against a Debug agent installed by ⌘R:

```
pgr_ctl status --debug
```

It addresses one configuration's library at a time and defaults to the
configuration it was built as, so `--debug`, `--release` or `--claude` is how you
reach another. `Documentation/pgr_ctl.md`.

## Testing the picture endpoint

The agent serves pictures over HTTP. Clients ask it for one and are handed the
bytes; they never open the database or the cache. From a terminal that means
`curl`.

**The port is fixed per build configuration and per user** — a base of 20000
release, 23000 Debug, 26000 Claude, plus a hash of the user's short name under
3000 — so two builds, or two people on one Mac, can run at once and neither has
to chase the other. Fixed per configuration since 2026-09-17, per user since
2026-09-21. A port already held by something else is still fallen back from
and published, so the published value is the one to use.

**Every request carries your secret.** The agent keeps one in its preference
domain beside the port, and answers `401` to anything without it — loopback is
shared by every account on the Mac, and this is what keeps another account's
requests out. Only you can read that domain. So set these three once per
terminal; every example below uses them:

```
DOMAIN=com.sydpolk.photosgoround.debug
PORT=$(defaults read "$DOMAIN" servicePort)
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $(defaults read "$DOMAIN" serviceSecret)"
```

`DOMAIN` is the build's: `com.sydpolk.photosgoround` for Release,
`….debug` for Debug and `….claude` for Claude. See
`Documentation/Photos-Go-Round Server.md`, *SERVICE*.

Start the agent in one terminal and leave it running — it prints the URL once the
listener is up, then a line for every request it answers:

```
./Scripts/run-server.sh
```

In another terminal, take a picture:

```
curl -sS -H "$AUTH" -D - -o /tmp/pgr.bin "http://localhost:$PORT/v1/next?consumer=cli&w=3840&h=2160"

```

The response headers say what you got — `Content-Type` for the format,
`X-PGR-Card` for the photo's row id, `X-PGR-Source` for its source.
Requesting again gives a *different* picture, because serving pops the queue.

`w` and `h` are maximums — nothing comes back larger than either — and what you
get is the largest that fits inside them with its aspect ratio intact. HEIC
unless you ask for JPEG with `Accept`. Leave both out and you get the original
bytes, untouched. Either way the extension matters if
you want Preview to open it, so save it with the one the `Content-Type` implies:

```
curl -sS -H "$AUTH" -D /tmp/pgr.head -o /tmp/pgr.body "http://localhost:$PORT/v1/next?w=3840&h=2160" && ext=$(awk -F/ 'tolower($0) ~ /^content-type/ {gsub(/\r/,""); print $2}' /tmp/pgr.head) && mv /tmp/pgr.body "/tmp/pgr.$ext" && open "/tmp/pgr.$ext"
```

Two answers that are not errors. **`204 No Content`** means the queue is empty —
a fresh library answers this way until the agent has produced something, and so
does a small library asked faster than it can refill. When the agent knows why,
it says so: `X-PGR-Empty: no-sources` with no source enabled, and `no-photos`
when there is nothing to show and nothing still being scanned. And four requests at once
never hand out the same picture, because serving removes the queue entry:

```
for c in a b c d; do curl -sS -H "$AUTH" -D - -o /dev/null "http://localhost:$PORT/v1/next?consumer=display-$c&w=1920&h=1080" & done; wait
```

## Managing sources over HTTP

The same listener manages the source list, because the database is private to the
agent — a client asks rather than opening the store. `pgr_ctl sources` does all of
this without the agent running; this is the path a shipping client takes.

List what is configured, with counts and availability:

```
curl -sS -H "$AUTH" "http://localhost:$PORT/v1/sources"
```

Add one or more. The body is an array, `kind` defaults to `folder`, and the batch
is all-or-none — one path that does not resolve refuses the lot and names it:

```
curl -sS -H "$AUTH" -X POST "http://localhost:$PORT/v1/sources" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '[{"path": "/Users/me/Pictures/Sunsets", "recursive": true}]'
```

The answer carries each new source's `uuid`, which is what names it afterwards —
the row id `pgr_ctl` prints belongs to a disposable database. It does **not** wait
for the folder to be scanned, so `photos` is zero until a later request:

```
curl -sS -H "$AUTH" "http://localhost:$PORT/v1/sources/<uuid>"
curl -sS -H "$AUTH" -X DELETE -D - "http://localhost:$PORT/v1/sources/<uuid>"
```

`DELETE` answers `204` and takes the source's photographs — and their cached
bytes — with it. Removal is not deletion: nothing on the source itself is
touched.

Change what a folder was added with, keeping its identity and its shuffle
position:

```
curl -sS -H "$AUTH" -X PATCH "http://localhost:$PORT/v1/sources/<uuid>" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"recursive": false}'
```
