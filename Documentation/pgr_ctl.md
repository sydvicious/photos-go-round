## DESCRIPTION

`pgr_ctl` is the rig. It is a separate binary from the agent, `Photos-Go-Round
Server`, because the service has exactly one job and answering questions is not
it.

**It configures and inspects; it does not hand out pictures.** Every command here
opens the same SQLite database or writes the same preference domain, then rings a
Darwin notification — so the agent does not have to be running for any of it to
work, and when it is running it notices within a tick.

Getting a picture is the agent's job and does not live here: a client asks it
over HTTP and is handed bytes. From a terminal that is `curl`; see *Testing the
picture endpoint* in `README.md`.

It is internal and never ships: it is not in any distributed bundle, has no
signing or notarization pipeline, and carries no compatibility promise —
subcommands may change shape whenever a phase makes that convenient. Being
unshipped does not make it a scratch script, though. `shuffle-test` holds the
project's real correctness checks for the deck, and they exit non-zero so CI can
run them exactly as a person does.

**Where a source lives is a preference, not a row.** `sources add`, `remove`,
`enable`, and `disable` write to `UserDefaults` and then reconcile the database
in the same breath. The source table is a projection of the durable list, and the
agent reconciles the two on a thirty-second poll — so a row written straight into
the database is deleted again within half a minute.

## OPTIONS

### Where the library is

Every command has to agree with the running agent about the container, so these
are spelled exactly as the agent spells them.

**One library per build, and the build is the only choice.** Syd, 2026-09-24:
"They should be completely separate builds with completely separate assets." A
build's library is one directory name, used for the container, the cache and the
preference domain, all under the user's own home so that two people on one Mac
never share a library. The four deployment flags went that day, with the second
library they chose between;
`./Scripts/scrub-data.sh` deletes what those left behind — see FILES.

`--release`, `--debug`, `--claude`
Whose build's library. Each build configuration has its own identifier —
`com.sydpolk.photosgoround`, `….debug`, `….claude` — so all three agents can run
at once without sharing a database. **Defaults to the configuration `pgr_ctl`
itself was built as**, which is the agent you are most likely running.

`--container <dir>`
Storage root. Defaults to `~/Library/Application Support/<identifier>` for the build above.

`-d`, `--database <path>`
Database file. Defaults to `<container>/photosgoround.sqlite`.

`--cache-root <dir>`
Cache root. Defaults to `~/Library/Caches/<identifier>`. Naming a container takes
the cache with it: give `--container` or `PGR_CONTAINER` and this defaults to
`<container>/cache` instead.

### Per command

`--folder <path>`, `--file <path>`
What `sources add` is adding, and required by it — at least one. Both are
repeatable, so several sources can be named in one command. Used by no other
command.

`--recursive`, `-r`
Walks subdirectories of the folder it precedes, and of no other. It belongs
between `--folder` and its path; standing on its own it is an error rather than a
setting for the command. Off unless asked for, because the surprising direction
is the expensive one: walking a home directory by accident costs minutes and
thousands of photographs nobody meant to add.

`--source <id>`
Scope `cache clear` to the one source with that id, instead of acting on all of
them. The id is the number `sources list` prints; note that it
is a row id in a disposable database, so deleting the library renumbers sources
from 1 and `--source 3` means "whichever is third now" rather than a particular
folder.

`--unavailable`
Scope `cache clear` to sources that are gone. These can never be re-fetched
anyway, which makes this the variant to reach for first: it frees space at zero
future cost.

`--yes`
Do not ask before clearing. Required when stdin is not a terminal.

`-n`, `--count <n>`
How many entries to peek at, or how many rounds to fill. Default: 10.

`-w`, `--window <0-1>`
Repeat window fraction for `shuffle-test`. Default: 0.5.

`--deals <n>`, `--photos <n>`
The size of the `shuffle-test` run. Defaults: 50000 deals across 4000 photos.

`--album <id>`
For `sources add`, a Photos album to add, by local identifier; repeatable and
mixable with `--folder` and `--file`.

`-f`, `--follow`, `--last <time>`
Stream the log rather than printing it, and how far back to read. Default: 1h.

`-h`, `--help`
Usage.

Flags may appear anywhere, including before the subcommand. Positionals are
collected first and interpreted last, so `sources add --folder /a -r` and
`-r --folder /a sources add` mean the same thing.

## COMMANDS

`status`
Sources, pool, queue, cache, shuffle position, and the preferences in force.
The one command to run when something is wrong and you do not yet know what. It
prints which rung supplied the roots, so that is never a guess. Its `service`
line is the published address and whether the secret every request needs is
published beside it — never the secret itself.

`sources add`
Adds one or more sources. `--folder <path>` enumerates a folder's contents;
`--folder --recursive <path>` walks its subdirectories too. `--file <path>` pins
one photograph — a first-class kind rather than a folder special case, since
pinning one photo and adding a folder of ten thousand are the same operation to
the deck. `--album <id>` adds a Photos album or smart album by its
`PHAssetCollection` local identifier, which the app's album picker uses and the
agent's `GET /v2/photos/albums` prints.

An album identifier is opaque: its slashes are not path separators, it is not
standardized, and it is stored exactly as given. **Nothing is added unless it
resolves in this Photos library**, under the same all-or-none rule as a
mistyped path — and a library that cannot be read refuses too, rather than
accepting an album nobody can see.

Both flags are repeatable and may be mixed, and each folder keeps its own answer
about recursion:

    pgr_ctl sources add --folder --recursive ~/Pictures/Albums \
                        --folder ~/Pictures/Wallpaper

Each is written to preferences and then scanned immediately, rather than making
you wait for the agent's next pass. A path that is already a source is a no-op.
**Nothing is added unless every path resolves**, so a command naming three
folders with one misspelled adds none of them.

`sources list`
Every source with its id, kind, photo count, and state — `ok`, `disabled`, or
`UNAVAILABLE` with the reason. The id it prints is what the other subcommands
take. This is also what a bare `pgr_ctl sources` does, that being the harmless
reading.

`sources remove <id>`
Drops it from preferences; its photos and their queue entries go with it by
cascade, and its cached bytes — originals and resized copies — are deleted at
that moment. Reports what it freed.

`sources enable <id>`, `sources disable <id>`
Switch a source off without discarding it. **Disabling is not removing**: the
photos leave the deck and the queue immediately, but keep their deal history, so
re-enabling brings them straight back where they were (_primarily for internal testing_).

`refresh`
Ask the agent to re-enumerate its sources, and return at once. **It does no
scanning itself**: the walk belongs to the agent, which reports what it is
refreshing and what each source took on its own console. Rescanning a network
share with thousands of photographs is minutes of work, and doing it here meant
enumerating it twice and blocking a terminal for the privilege.

Every enabled source, because the doorbell is a Darwin notification and those
carry no payload — `--source` is refused rather than quietly ignored. With no
agent running it says so: nothing will act on it, which is not an error but is
worth knowing.

`pool stats`
Rows per source, split by what explains everything else — referenced against
materialized, how much has bytes, and how much is claimed by a lane that is
fetching it right now. Held is the cache's fact, not a gate on the deck's: the
deck deals every photograph from an enabled source whether or not it has bytes
yet, and the queue fetches what it holds.

`queue peek`
The deck, head first: which photographs will be shown, in the order they will be
shown, each with the source it came from and whether it is read in place or
copied. **The whole deck unless `-n` narrows it** — it is twenty cards, so
showing part of it by default answered a question nobody asked.

The trailing line is the deck's depth against the pool it was dealt from —
every photograph from an enabled source. Peeking consumes nothing.

Sources are numbered, not named — `source 12`, the same words the agent's
served line uses. `sources list` is where an id becomes a path, and keeping that
job in one place is what lets a deck and a log be read against each other
without translating.

`queue fill`
Does the agent's topping-up by hand: deals cards from every available
photograph, synchronously, and reports what each round produced. Takes `-n` for
how many rounds, and stops early when a round produces nothing. This is the only
way to fill a queue with no agent running.

**It fetches nothing.** Dealing reads a row and writes a row; a card is dealt
whether or not its bytes are here, and fetching them is the queue's business in
the running agent.

`deck stats`
Where the shuffle stands, plus the distribution of showing counts. `times_shown`
is a statistic and nothing orders by it, which is what makes it the honest
measure: a spread of one to three across a library is a healthy fraction below
1.0, and a spread of three to four hundred is starvation.

**The pool it reports is every available photograph** — enabled source, still
image — and the `cache` line beneath it is the separate fact of how many have
bytes and how many are still waiting to be fetched. A pool below the library
means sources disabled or rows that are video; never a cache that has not caught
up, and never a source that is unreachable.

The number to watch beside them is the remote half's share of the showing
histogram: it should match that half's share of the library, and falling below
means the fetches are not keeping up.

`cache status`
Originals held, how many photographs are referenced in place rather than copied,
how many are waiting for bytes, what is on disk against the byte ceiling —
originals and resized copies together — and
what is free on the volume. Also the number of queued pictures.

`cache evict`
Runs an eviction pass now: the same pass the agent runs after every file it
writes to the cache. When everything fits under the ceiling it takes nothing, and says so.
Reports what went and what it freed.

**Oldest file first, originals and resized copies alike, by when the file was
made.** An original's age is when it was fetched, however recently it was shown.
Nothing is held back but the last original — an exemption is a ceiling that
cannot be reached, which matters when the ceiling is set low or the volume fills
from outside the agent.

`cache clear`
Discards cached bytes — originals and resized copies — optionally scoped by
`--source` or to `--unavailable` sources. Prompts with data of how much would be cleared and asks
for confirmation to proceed. It does not touch anything else in the system, including
shuffle order (_internal testing only_).

`shuffle-test`
Test the shuffle algorithms against a dummy library of empty files and an in-memory
database (_internal testing only_).

`get [<key>] [--no-default-values]`
Reads preferences. With no key it lists every setting with its stored value, or
`(default)` where nothing is stored. With a key it prints that value alone, for
scripts — an empty line if nothing is stored, rather than the default the agent
would use. An unknown key is an error.

`--no-default-values` reports only what is stored, leaving a setting blank where
nothing is — so a script can tell "nobody has chosen" from "chosen to be the
same as the default", which the ordinary listing deliberately blurs.

`set <key> <value>`
Writes one preference, to the current domain. A running agent picks the change
up immediately. For a list of valid keys, see `get`.

`wallpaper get [<key>]`
Reads the wallpaper's own preferences, which live in
`com.sydpolk.photosgoround.wallpaper` rather than in the domain `get` reads. The
domain carries the build configuration as the library does:
`….debug.wallpaper` with `--debug`, `….claude.wallpaper` with `--claude`. With no key it lists every setting; with a key it prints that
value alone, for scripts. An unset `interval` reports the value the wallpaper
would use. The only key is `interval`.

`wallpaper set <key> <value>`
Writes one of them. `interval` takes a *Shuffle All* tag such as
`thirtyMinutes` or `oneHour`, and anything else is refused with the list of
valid tags. The app's Settings window writes the same domain, and the wallpaper
extension reads it again at each change of picture.

`notify <topic>`
Announces that something changed, without changing it, so that every process
listening goes and looks. Valid topics are `prefs`, `sources`, `deck`, and
`cache` — the preferences, the source list, the shuffle's position, and the
cached bytes respectively.

The bell is scoped to the library, so it reaches only processes that have the
same database open. The build flags, `--container` and `--database` therefore decide
whose bell rings, and the posted name is printed so it can be checked against
the agent being watched.

`log`
What this project's processes have recorded. They all write to the system log
under one subsystem, and this reads back that subsystem and nothing else. `-f`
follows it as it happens; `--last` bounds how far back to read.

## ENVIRONMENT

`PGR_CONTAINER`
Storage root. Same as `--container`; the flag wins.

`PGR_DATABASE`
Database file. Same as `--database`; the flag wins.

`PGR_CACHE`
Cache root. Same as `--cache-root`; the flag wins.

Setting `PGR_CONTAINER` once per shell is the usual way to work.

## FILES

`<container>/photosgoround.sqlite`
The database, and its WAL sidecars.

`<cache>/`
Materialized photo bytes. Only photos on volumes that can disappear are copied;
anything on the boot volume is read where it lies.

`Scripts/scrub-data.sh`
Deletes a build's data, named by `--variant release|debug|claude` or `--all`: its
container, cache and preferences, the screensaver's and wallpaper's domains, and
the same under every retired name — the `.dev` library, the old `.dev` and `.prod`
domains — after stopping that build's agent. `--dry-run` says what
would go; `--yes` skips the prompt. Every name it touches is spelled in it and
ends in `.dev` or `.prod`, and none can be overridden, so no library a current
build uses is reachable from it (_internal testing only_).

## EXIT STATUS

`0` on success. `1` on a command that could not do what it was asked — no library
at the container, no such source, an unknown preference, a refused clear, or a
failed `shuffle-test` assertion.

## EXAMPLES

Point every command at the same library as the agent, once per shell:

```
export PGR_CONTAINER="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Photos-Go-Round"
```

Add a folder and watch the queue fill behind it:

```
pgr_ctl sources add --folder --recursive ~/Pictures/Wallpaper
pgr_ctl status
```

Prove the queue pop serialises across clients. Read the port and the secret the
agent published — every request has to carry the secret, and `pgr_ctl` never
prints it. `DOMAIN` is the agent's preference domain; see `README.md`, *Testing
the picture endpoint*, for each configuration's:

```
DOMAIN=com.sydpolk.photosgoround
PORT=$(defaults read "$DOMAIN" servicePort)
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $(defaults read "$DOMAIN" serviceSecret)"
for c in a b c d; do
  curl -sS -H "$AUTH" -D - -o /dev/null "http://localhost:$PORT/v1/next?consumer=display-$c&w=1920&h=1080" &
done; wait
```

Run the deck's correctness checks:

```
pgr_ctl shuffle-test --deals 50000 --photos 4000
pgr_ctl shuffle-test --deals 50000 --photos 4000 -w 1.0
```
