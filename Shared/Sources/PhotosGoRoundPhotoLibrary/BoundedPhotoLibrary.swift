/// distinction is the whole reason this type exists: `title(ofCollection:)`
/// answering `nil` is what `availability` reads as `.missing`, which is what
/// offers a person the button that removes an album and its photographs. A
/// library that is slow, rebuilding, or migrating to a spinning disk must not be
