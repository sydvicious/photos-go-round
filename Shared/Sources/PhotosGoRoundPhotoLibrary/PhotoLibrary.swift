/// The system photo library, as much of it as a provider needs.
///
/// **The seam exists because PhotoKit cannot be put in a test.** Exercising it
/// needs a real library, a real TCC grant, and somebody's actual photographs,
/// which between them make every interesting case — an album that vanished, an
/// asset whose original is in iCloud, a Live Photo whose resource list is a trap
/// — either unreachable or destructive to arrange. `FolderSourceProvider` sits
/// behind `FileAccess` for the same reason and this mirrors it deliberately.
///
/// **Nothing here is a PhotoKit type.** The protocol vends values, so a fake can
/// answer it without importing Photos and the provider's logic — which resource
/// to take, what counts as gone, when to refuse to guess — is exercised with no
/// library present at all. A seam that handed back `PHAsset` would move the
/// untestable part one layer up and change nothing.
///
/// **Almost everything here throws, and that is the whole of the 2026-09-07
/// change.** The values these calls answer with — `nil`, `[]`, `false` — all
/// mean *the library says no*, and `nil` from `title(ofCollection:)` is what
/// `availability` reads as `.missing`, which is what offers a person the button
/// that removes an album and its photographs. A library that has stopped
/// answering must not be able to reach that button. So *I did not get an answer*
/// is a third thing, thrown rather than returned, and every caller has to decide
/// what it means rather than inheriting the meaning of *no*.
