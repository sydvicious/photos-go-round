/// **Because listing is cheap and counting is not.** Phase 1 measured 439
/// collections at 34 seconds to count — a flat ~78 ms round trip per album,
/// whatever its size — while fetching the collections themselves is
/// milliseconds. `estimatedAssetCount`, the documented way out, is `NSNotFound`
/// for every smart album, which is to say for Favorites and Live Photos and
/// everything else anybody actually asks for.
///
/// So a picker cannot be handed a counted list at a speed anybody would wait
/// for. It is handed the names at once and the numbers as they arrive: the
/// panel already re-reads on a timer, so a count appearing thirty seconds later
/// costs nothing and needs no push.
///
/// **Counts survive relisting and do not expire.** A collection is counted once
/// per agent lifetime; the count of an album somebody adds photographs to
/// afterwards goes stale, and that is accepted. It is a number beside a name in
/// a chooser, not anything the deck reads — and the alternative is re-paying 34
/// seconds of round trips on a schedule to keep a cosmetic figure current.
