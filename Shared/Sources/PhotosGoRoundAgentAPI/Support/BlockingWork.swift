/// **Swift's cooperative pool has about as many threads as the machine has
/// cores, and a thread parked in a synchronous system call is one the runtime
/// cannot use for anything else.** Enough of them and nothing runs at all —
/// which is not a deadlock and does not look like one: no lock is held, no
/// cycle exists, the process simply stops.
///
/// This project has hit that twice.
///
/// **2026-08-25**, from `FileAccess`: a walk of a network folder writing into
/// batched transactions synchronously from an async task, where four concurrent
/// walks were enough to stop the agent answering picture requests. Fixed there
/// by giving the sink an async form.
///
/// **2026-08-26**: `FileManager.copyItem` against an iCloud Drive file that was
/// not downloaded. The read hands off to `bird` and does not return — not
/// slowly, at all — and once a fetch could be abandoned on a deadline while its
/// copy kept running, eleven of them took every thread in the pool.
///
/// A blocked thread here costs a thread here. Dispatch grows this queue as work
/// arrives and the runtime goes on running, so abandoning a fetch becomes a
/// real thing to do rather than a promise the abandoned work refuses to keep.
///
/// **It is not a place to put work that merely takes a while.** Anything that
/// suspends properly — a network request, a database write behind an async
/// transaction — belongs on the cooperative pool where it can yield. This is
/// for calls that will not yield because they cannot.
