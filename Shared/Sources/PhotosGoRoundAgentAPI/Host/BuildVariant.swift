/// Which build this is, decided by the compiler rather than by anything a run
/// discovers.
///
/// **Three configurations, all fully supported.** Syd, 2026-09-19: "There are
/// three configurations, debug, release, claude. all fully supported." A
/// release, Syd's Debug, and a build made by an agent — each with its own port,
/// its own LaunchAgent label, its own screensaver bundle name and its own
/// wallpaper extension identifier, so that all three can be installed and
/// running on one Mac at once and none can be mistaken for another.
///
/// **The variant also decides the library**, since 2026-09-24: each build has
/// exactly one set of assets, named by `Storage.name(for:)`. `PGR_AGENT_CLAUDE` is set by the
/// `Claude` build configuration and by `swift build -Xswiftc
/// -DPGR_AGENT_CLAUDE`; `DEBUG` is what an Xcode or SwiftPM debug build defines
/// for itself. `Claude` defines both, and is checked first.
///
/// **The suffixes below are stated twice, and cannot be stated once.** Xcode
/// needs them as build settings — `SAVER_NAME_SUFFIX`, `SERVER_LABEL_SUFFIX`,
/// `WALLPAPER_ID_SUFFIX` at project level in `project.pbxproj` — because they
/// shape product names and `Info.plist` values before any Swift runs, and Swift
/// cannot read an `.xcconfig` at runtime. The two must agree. Anything that can
/// read the built bundle should prefer what the bundle carries:
/// `PGRLaunchAgentLabel` in the agent's `Info.plist` is the label that install
/// actually used, and is the truth for a bundle in hand.
