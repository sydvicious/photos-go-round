# Takes Photos-Go-Round off this Mac. `Build Plan.md`, *The install phases*.
#
# Syd, 2026-09-15: "we need an uninstall script for all of these agents". Three
# installs put things in three places — a LaunchAgent, a plug-in registration and
# a bundle in Screen Savers — and the one you forget is the one that keeps
# running. Three build configurations mean three of each.
#
# **It is a wrapper, not an implementation.** Syd, 2026-09-19: "there should not
# be multiple versions of the build scripts. the targets and the command line
# builds should share their guts, and behave the same, based on input
# parameters." Everything this does lives in `PhotosGoRoundInstall` and is driven
# by `pgr_install uninstall`, which is the same code `Install …` schemes run and
# the same code the app will link when it becomes the installer.
#
# **It removes what was installed, not what was built.** Build directories, the
# library, the cache and the preferences are left alone: uninstalling is not the
# same as throwing away the photographs you chose. `Scripts/scrub-data.sh` is the
# one that deletes a build's data.
#
# **Nothing here needs the checkout that installed it.** Everything is found by
# label, identifier and name — so it removes a Release install as readily as a
# Debug one, whoever built them.
#
# **Every uninstall says which build.** Syd, 2026-09-24: "I want all installers
# and uninstallers that I run to take a --variant argument, and accept --all for
# all three variants." Until then it removed every configuration's copy
# whatever was asked. `Scripts/variants.sh`.

Removes what Photos-Go-Round's installs put on this Mac.

USAGE
  ./Scripts/uninstall.sh (--variant <name> ... | --all) [--agent] [--wallpaper] [--saver] [--widget] [--dry-run]

  --variant <name>  release, debug or claude: whose copies to remove. May be
                    given more than once.
  --all             All three configurations' copies.

WHAT EACH ONE REMOVES
  --agent       Boots out the LaunchAgent and deletes its plist from
                ~/Library/LaunchAgents. An agent somebody started by hand is
                reported and left alone. The built bundles stay where they are.
  --wallpaper   Unregisters the wallpaper extension and stops its processes. If
                it is the chosen wallpaper, macOS falls back to a default
                picture.
  --saver       Deletes the Photos-Go-Round Screensaver bundle from
                ~/Library/Screen Savers and stops the hosts holding it.
  --widget      Unregisters the widget extension and stops its process. Any
                widget placed on the desktop or in Notification Center goes
                with it. The app that carries the extension stays where it is,
                and registers it again the next time it is built or launched.
                With none of the four, it removes all of them.
  --dry-run     Says what would go and removes nothing.

WHAT IT NEVER TOUCHES
  The library, the cache, preferences, and anything under a build directory. See
  Scripts/scrub-data.sh for those.
